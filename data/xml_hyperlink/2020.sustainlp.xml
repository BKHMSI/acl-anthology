      <abstract>We compare three solutions to UKARA 1.0 challenge on automated short-answer scoring : single classical, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ensemble_learning">ensemble classical</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning">deep learning</a>. The task is to classify given answers to two questions, whether they are right or wrong. While recent development shows increasing model complexity to push the benchmark performances, they tend to be resource-demanding with mundane improvement. For the UKARA task, we found that bag-of-words and classical machine learning approaches can compete with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ensemble_learning">ensemble models</a> and Bi-LSTM model with pre-trained word2vec embedding from 200 million words. In this case, the single classical machine learning achieved less than 2 % difference in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-number">F1</a> compared to the deep learning approach with 1/18 time for model training.</abstract>

      <abstract>Extracting biomedical relations from large corpora of scientific documents is a challenging natural language processing task. Existing approaches usually focus on identifying a relation either in a single sentence (mention-level) or across an entire corpus (pair-level). In both cases, recent methods have achieved strong results by learning a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_estimation">point estimate</a> to represent the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_relation">relation</a> ; this is then used as the input to a relation classifier. However, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_relation">relation</a> expressed in text between a pair of biomedical entities is often more complex than can be captured by a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_estimate">point estimate</a>. To address this issue, we propose a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_variable_model">latent variable model</a> with an arbitrarily flexible distribution to represent the relation between an entity pair. Additionally, our <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_model">model</a> provides a unified architecture for both mention-level and pair-level relation extraction. We demonstrate that our <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model">model</a> achieves results competitive with strong baselines for both tasks while having fewer parameters and being significantly faster to train. We make our code publicly available.</abstract>

      <abstract>Deep neural networks have demonstrated their superior performance in almost every Natural Language Processing task, however, their increasing complexity raises concerns. A particular concern is that these <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network">networks</a> pose high requirements for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_hardware">computing hardware</a> and training budgets. The state-of-the-art transformer models are a vivid example. Simplifying the computations performed by a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network">network</a> is one way of addressing the issue of the increasing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_complexity_theory">complexity</a>. In this paper, we propose an end to end binarized neural network for the task of intent and text classification. In order to fully utilize the potential of end to end binarization, both the input representations (vector embeddings of tokens statistics) and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_classification">classifier</a> are binarized. We demonstrate the efficiency of such a network on the intent classification of short texts over three <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_set">datasets</a> and text classification with a larger dataset. On the considered <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_set">datasets</a>, the proposed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network">network</a> achieves comparable to the state-of-the-art results while utilizing 20-40 % lesser <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_memory">memory</a> and training time compared to the benchmarks.</abstract>

      <abstract>In recent years, large pre-trained models have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in many of NLP tasks. However, the deployment of these <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model">models</a> on devices with limited resources is challenging due to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model">models</a>’ large <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computation">computational consumption</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_memory">memory requirements</a>. Moreover, the need for a considerable amount of labeled training data also hinders real-world deployment scenarios. Model distillation has shown promising results for reducing model size, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Load_(computing)">computational load</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_efficiency">data efficiency</a>. In this paper we test the boundaries of BERT model distillation in terms of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_compression">model compression</a>, inference efficiency and data scarcity. We show that classification tasks that require the capturing of general lexical semantics can be successfully distilled by very simple and efficient models and require relatively small amount of labeled training data. We also show that the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distillation">distillation</a> of large pre-trained models is more effective in real-life scenarios where limited amounts of labeled training are available.</abstract>

      <abstract>Understanding the influence of a training instance on a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_network">neural network model</a> leads to improving <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpretability">interpretability</a>. However, it is difficult and inefficient to evaluate the influence, which shows how a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model">model</a>’s prediction would be changed if a training instance were not used. In this paper, we propose an efficient <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methodology">method</a> for estimating the influence. Our method is inspired by dropout, which zero-masks a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subnetwork">sub-network</a> and prevents the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subnetwork">sub-network</a> from learning each training instance. By switching between dropout masks, we can use sub-networks that learned or did not learn each training instance and estimate its influence. Through experiments with BERT and VGGNet on classification datasets, we demonstrate that the proposed method can capture training influences, enhance the interpretability of error predictions, and cleanse the training dataset for improving <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalization">generalization</a>.</abstract>

In this work, we look for the optimal combination of known techniques to optimize <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_complexity">inference speed</a> without sacrificing translation quality. We conduct an empirical study that stacks various approaches and demonstrates that combination of replacing decoder self-attention with simplified recurrent units, adopting a deep encoder and a shallow decoder architecture and multi-head attention pruning can achieve up to 109 % and 84 % speedup on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit">CPU</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit">GPU</a> respectively and reduce the number of parameters by 25 % while maintaining the same translation quality in terms of BLEU.</abstract>

      <abstract>We address the problem of unsupervised extractive document summarization, especially for long documents. We model the unsupervised problem as a sparse auto-regression one and approximate the resulting combinatorial problem via a convex, norm-constrained problem. We solve it using a dedicated <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank-Wolfe_algorithm">Frank-Wolfe algorithm</a>. To generate a summary with k sentences, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm">algorithm</a> only needs to execute approximately k iterations, making it very efficient for a long document. We evaluate our approach against two other <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unsupervised_learning">unsupervised methods</a> using both lexical (standard) ROUGE scores, as well as semantic (embedding-based) ones. Our method achieves better results with both <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_set">datasets</a> and works especially well when combined with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embedding">embeddings</a> for highly paraphrased summaries.</abstract>

      <abstract>Learning-based slot filling-a key component of spoken language understanding systems-typically requires a large amount of in-domain hand-labeled data for training. In this paper, we propose a novel two-stage model architecture that can be trained with only a few in-domain hand-labeled examples. The first step is designed to remove non-slot tokens (i.e., O labeled tokens), as they introduce <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noise_(signal_processing)">noise</a> in the input of slot filling models. This step is domain-agnostic and therefore, can be trained by exploiting out-of-domain data. The second step identifies slot names only for slot tokens by using state-of-the-art pretrained contextual embeddings such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELMO">ELMO</a> and BERT. We show that our approach outperforms other state-of-art systems on the SNIPS benchmark dataset.</abstract>

      <abstract>Pre-trained language models such as BERT have shown their effectiveness in various tasks. Despite their power, they are known to be computationally intensive, which hinders real-world applications. In this paper, we introduce early exiting BERT for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_ranking">document ranking</a>. With a slight modification, BERT becomes a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model">model</a> with multiple output paths, and each inference sample can exit early from these <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_(graph_theory)">paths</a>. In this way, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computation">computation</a> can be effectively allocated among samples, and overall <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latency_(engineering)">system latency</a> is significantly reduced while the original <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_(business)">quality</a> is maintained. Our experiments on two document ranking datasets demonstrate up to 2.5x <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_complexity">inference speedup</a> with minimal quality degradation.

In this work, we tackle the challenge of fine-tuning these <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model">models</a> for specific domains in a data and computationally efficient manner. Typically, researchers fine-tune <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_model">models</a> using corpus-specific labeled data from sources such as TREC. We first answer the question : How much data of this type do we need? Recognizing that the most computationally efficient training is no training, we explore zero-shot ranking using BERT models that have already been fine-tuned with the large MS MARCO passage retrieval dataset. We arrive at the surprising and novel finding that some labeled in-domain data can be worse than none at all.</abstract>

      <abstract>Pre-trained Transformer-based models are achieving state-of-the-art results on a variety of Natural Language Processing data sets. However, the size of these <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_model">models</a> is often a drawback for their deployment in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing">real production applications</a>. In the case of multilingual models, most of the parameters are located in the embeddings layer. Therefore, reducing the vocabulary size should have an important impact on the total number of parameters. In this paper, we propose to extract smaller <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_model">models</a> that handle fewer number of languages according to the targeted corpora. We present an evaluation of smaller versions of multilingual BERT on the XNLI data set, but we believe that this method may be applied to other multilingual transformers. The obtained results confirm that we can generate smaller <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model">models</a> that keep comparable results, while reducing up to 45 % of the total number of parameters. We compared our models with DistilmBERT (a distilled version of multilingual BERT) and showed that unlike language reduction, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distillation">distillation</a> induced a 1.7 % to 6 % drop in the overall accuracy on the XNLI data set.

      <abstract>Accurate and reliable measurement of energy consumption is critical for making well-informed design choices when choosing and training large scale NLP models. In this work, we show that existing software-based energy estimations are not accurate because they do not take into account hardware differences and how resource utilization affects <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_consumption">energy consumption</a>. We conduct energy measurement experiments with four different <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model">models</a> for a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Question_answering">question answering task</a>. We quantify the error of existing software-based energy estimations by using a hardware power meter that provides highly accurate energy measurements. Our key takeaway is the need for a more accurate energy estimation model that takes into account hardware variabilities and the non-linear relationship between resource utilization and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_consumption">energy consumption</a>.

      <abstract>We describe the SustaiNLP 2020 shared task : efficient inference on the SuperGLUE benchmark (Wang et al., 2019). Participants are evaluated based on performance on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benchmarking">benchmark</a> as well as energy consumed in making predictions on the test sets. We describe the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Task_(project_management)">task</a>, its organization, and the submitted <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System">systems</a>. Across the six submissions to the shared task, participants achieved efficiency gains of 20 over a standard BERT (Devlin et al., 2019) baseline, while losing less than an absolute point in performance.</abstract>
