      <abstract>While neural machine translation (NMT) models provide improved translation quality in an elegant framework, it is less clear what they learn about language. Recent work has started evaluating the quality of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space">vector representations</a> learned by NMT models on morphological and syntactic tasks. In this paper, we investigate the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representation_(mathematics)">representations</a> learned at different layers of NMT encoders. We train NMT systems on parallel data and use the models to extract <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_(machine_learning)">features</a> for training a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_classification">classifier</a> on two tasks : part-of-speech and semantic tagging. We then measure the performance of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_classification">classifier</a> as a proxy to the quality of the original NMT model for the given task. Our quantitative analysis yields interesting insights regarding <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representation_learning">representation learning</a> in NMT models. For instance, we find that higher layers are better at learning <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantics">semantics</a> while lower layers tend to be better for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Part-of-speech_tagging">part-of-speech tagging</a>. We also observe little effect of the target language on source-side representations, especially in higher quality models.</abstract>

      <abstract>In Neural Machine Translation (NMT), each word is represented as a low-dimension, real-value vector for encoding its syntax and semantic information. This means that even if the word is in a different sentence context, it is represented as the fixed vector to learn source representation. Moreover, a large number of Out-Of-Vocabulary (OOV) words, which have different syntax and semantic information, are represented as the same vector representation of unk. To alleviate this problem, we propose a novel context-aware smoothing method to dynamically learn a sentence-specific vector for each word (including OOV words) depending on its local context words in a sentence. The learned context-aware representation is integrated into the NMT to improve the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation_(biology)">translation</a> performance. Empirical results on NIST Chinese-to-English translation task show that the proposed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_methods_for_ordinary_differential_equations">approach</a> achieves 1.78 BLEU improvements on average over a strong attentional NMT, and outperforms some existing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_methods_for_ordinary_differential_equations">systems</a>.</abstract>

      <abstract>Attention in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_machine_translation">neural machine translation</a> provides the possibility to encode relevant parts of the source sentence at each translation step. As a result, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention">attention</a> is considered to be an alignment model as well. However, there is no work that specifically studies <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention">attention</a> and provides analysis of what is being learned by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention">attention models</a>. Thus, the question still remains that how <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention">attention</a> is similar or different from the traditional alignment. In this paper, we provide detailed analysis of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention">attention</a> and compare it to traditional alignment. We answer the question of whether <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention">attention</a> is only capable of modelling translational equivalent or it captures more information. We show that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention">attention</a> is different from alignment in some cases and is capturing useful information other than alignments.</abstract>

      <abstract>In this paper, we propose a probabilistic parsing model that defines a proper <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditional_probability_distribution">conditional probability distribution</a> over non-projective dependency trees for a given sentence, using neural representations as inputs. The neural network architecture is based on bi-directional LSTMCNNs, which automatically benefits from both word- and character-level representations, by using a combination of bidirectional LSTMs and CNNs. On top of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_network">neural network</a>, we introduce a probabilistic structured layer, defining a conditional log-linear model over non-projective trees. By exploiting Kirchhoff’s Matrix-Tree Theorem (Tutte, 1984), the partition functions and marginals can be computed efficiently, leading to a straightforward end-to-end model training procedure via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backpropagation">back-propagation</a>. We evaluate our <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model">model</a> on 17 different datasets, across 14 different languages. Our <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsing">parser</a> achieves state-of-the-art <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsing">parsing</a> performance on nine datasets.</abstract>

      <abstract>We present a pointwise mutual information (PMI)-based approach to formalize paraphrasability and propose a variant of PMI, called MIPA, for the paraphrase acquisition. Our paraphrase acquisition method first acquires lexical paraphrase pairs by bilingual pivoting and then reranks them by PMI and distributional similarity. The complementary nature of information from bilingual corpora and from monolingual corpora makes the proposed method robust. Experimental results show that the proposed method substantially outperforms bilingual pivoting and distributional similarity themselves in terms of metrics such as MRR, MAP, coverage, and Spearman’s correlation.</abstract>

      <abstract>Implicit semantic role labeling (iSRL) is the task of predicting the semantic roles of a predicate that do not appear as explicit arguments, but rather regard common sense knowledge or are mentioned earlier in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discourse">discourse</a>. We introduce an approach to iSRL based on a predictive recurrent neural semantic frame model (PRNSFM) that uses a large unannotated corpus to learn the probability of a sequence of semantic arguments given a predicate. We leverage the sequence probabilities predicted by the PRNSFM to estimate selectional preferences for predicates and their arguments. On the NomBank iSRL test set, our approach improves state-of-the-art performance on implicit semantic role labeling with less reliance than prior work on manually constructed language resources.</abstract>

      <abstract>To learn more knowledge, enabling transitivity is a vital step for lexical inference. However, most of the lexical inference models with good performance are for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noun">nouns</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noun_phrase">noun phrases</a>, which can not be directly applied to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inference">inference</a> on events or states. In this paper, we construct the largest Chinese verb lexical inference dataset containing 18,029 verb pairs, where for each pair one of four inference relations are annotated. We further build a probabilistic soft logic (PSL) model to infer verb lexicons using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_language">logic language</a>. With PSL, we easily enable transitivity in two layers, the observed layer and the feature layer, which are included in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_base">knowledge base</a>. We further discuss the effect of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transient_(oscillation)">transitives</a> within and between these <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lattice_model_(physics)">layers</a>. Results show the performance of the proposed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_differential_equation">PSL model</a> can be improved at least 3.5 % (relative) when the transitivity is enabled. Furthermore, experiments show that enabling transitivity in the observed layer benefits the most.</abstract>

We focus on neural end-to-end models that combine both inputs mt (raw MT output) and src (source language input) in a single neural architecture, modeling   pe directly. Apart from that, we investigate the influence of hard-attention models which seem to be well-suited for monolingual tasks, as well as combinations of both ideas. We report results on data sets provided during the WMT-2016 shared task on automatic post-editing and can demonstrate that dual-attention models that incorporate all available data in the APE scenario in a single model improve on the best shared task system and on all other published results after the shared task.

      <abstract>We decompose multimodal translation into two sub-tasks : learning to translate and learning visually grounded representations. In a multitask learning framework, translations are learned in an attention-based encoder-decoder, and grounded representations are learned through image representation prediction. Our approach improves <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation">translation</a> performance compared to the state of the art on the Multi30 K dataset. Furthermore, it is equally effective if we train the image prediction task on the external MS COCO dataset, and we find improvements if we train the translation model on the external News Commentary parallel text.</abstract>

      <abstract>End-to-end training makes the neural machine translation (NMT) architecture simpler, yet elegant compared to traditional statistical machine translation (SMT). However, little is known about linguistic patterns of morphology, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntax">syntax</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantics">semantics</a> learned during the training of NMT systems, and more importantly, which parts of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_architecture">architecture</a> are responsible for learning each of these phenomenon. In this paper we i) analyze how much <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(linguistics)">morphology</a> an NMT decoder learns, and ii) investigate whether injecting target morphology in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code">decoder</a> helps it to produce better translations. To this end we present three methods : i) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simultaneous_translation">simultaneous translation</a>, ii) joint-data learning, and iii) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-task_learning">multi-task learning</a>. Our results show that explicit <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(linguistics)">morphological information</a> helps the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning">decoder</a> learn target language morphology and improves the translation quality by 0.20.6 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_description">BLEU points</a>.</abstract>

We propose a method to combine the advantages of traditional SMT and NMT by exploiting an existing phrase-based SMT model to compute the phrase-based decoding cost for an NMT output and then using the phrase-based decoding cost to rerank the n-best NMT outputs. The main challenge in implementing this approach is that NMT outputs may not be in the search space of the standard phrase-based decoding algorithm, because the search space of phrase-based SMT is limited by the phrase-based translation rule table. We propose a soft forced decoding algorithm, which can always successfully find a decoding path for any NMT output. We show that using the forced decoding cost to rerank the NMT outputs can successfully improve translation quality on four different language pairs.</abstract>

      <abstract>Character-based sequence labeling framework is flexible and efficient for Chinese word segmentation (CWS). Recently, many character-based neural models have been applied to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_fluid_dynamics">CWS</a>. While they obtain good performance, they have two obvious weaknesses. The first is that they heavily rely on manually designed bigram feature, i.e. they are not good at capturing n-gram features automatically. The second is that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/They">they</a> make no use of full word information. For the first weakness, we propose a convolutional neural model, which is able to capture rich n-gram features without any <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_engineering">feature engineering</a>. For the second one, we propose an effective approach to integrate the proposed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_model">model</a> with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_embedding">word embeddings</a>. We evaluate the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model">model</a> on two benchmark datasets : PKU and MSR. Without any <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_feature">feature engineering</a>, the model obtains competitive performance   95.7 % on PKU and 97.3 % on MSR.

      <abstract>Boundary features are widely used in traditional Chinese Word Segmentation (CWS) methods as they can utilize unlabeled data to help improve the Out-of-Vocabulary (OOV) word recognition performance. Although various neural network methods for CWS have achieved performance competitive with state-of-the-art systems, these methods, constrained by the domain and size of the training corpus, do not work well in domain adaptation. In this paper, we propose a novel BLSTM-based neural network model which incorporates a global recurrent structure designed for modeling <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_value_problem">boundary features</a> dynamically. Experiments show that the proposed structure can effectively boost the performance of Chinese Word Segmentation, especially OOV-Recall, which brings benefits to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_adaptation">domain adaptation</a>. We achieved state-of-the-art results on 6 domains of CNKI articles, and competitive results to the best reported on the 4 domains of SIGHAN Bakeoff 2010 data.</abstract>

      <abstract>We present a novel technique for segmenting chat conversations using the information bottleneck method (Tishby et al., 2000), augmented with sequential continuity constraints. Furthermore, we utilize critical non-textual clues such as time between two consecutive posts and people mentions within the posts. To ascertain the effectiveness of the proposed method, we have collected data from public Slack conversations and Fresco, a proprietary platform deployed inside our organization. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method yields an absolute (relative) improvement of as high as 3.23 % (11.25 %). To facilitate future research, we are releasing manual annotations for segmentation on public Slack conversations.</abstract>

      <abstract>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_representation">distributed representation</a> has become a popular approach to capturing a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meaning_(linguistics)">word meaning</a>. Besides its success and practical value, however, questions arise about the relationships between a true word meaning and its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_representation">distributed representation</a>. In this paper, we examine such a relationship via polymodal embedding approach inspired by the theory that humans tend to use diverse sources in developing a word meaning. The result suggests that the existing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embedding">embeddings</a> lack in capturing certain aspects of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantics">word meanings</a> which can be significantly improved by the polymodal approach. Also, we show distinct characteristics of different types of words (e.g. concreteness) via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_neuroscience">computational studies</a>. Finally, we show our proposed embedding method outperforms the baselines in the word similarity measure tasks and the hypernym prediction tasks.</abstract>

      <abstract>Word embeddings are commonly compared either with human-annotated word similarities or through improvements in natural language processing tasks.

      <abstract>Unsupervised segmentation of phoneme sequences is an essential process to obtain unknown words during <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialogue">spoken dialogues</a>. In this segmentation, an input <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoneme">phoneme sequence</a> without delimiters is converted into segmented sub-sequences corresponding to words. The Pitman-Yor semi-Markov model (PYSMM) is promising for this problem, but its performance degrades when it is applied to phoneme-level word segmentation. This is because of insufficient cues for the segmentation, e.g., <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homophone">homophones</a> are improperly treated as single entries and their different contexts are also confused. We propose a phoneme-length context model for PYSMM to give a helpful cue at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoneme">phoneme-level</a> and to predict succeeding segments more accurately. Our experiments showed that the peak performance with our <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Context_model">context model</a> outperformed those without such a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Context_model">context model</a> by 0.045 at most in terms of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-number">F-measures</a> of estimated segmentation.</abstract>

      <abstract>Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have recently achieved remarkably strong performance on the practically important task of sentence classification (Kim, 2014 ; Kalchbrenner et al., 2014 ; Johnson and Zhang, 2014 ; Zhang et al., 2016). However, these models require practitioners to specify an exact model architecture and set accompanying hyperparameters, including the filter region size, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regularization_(mathematics)">regularization parameters</a>, and so on. It is currently unknown how sensitive <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model">model</a> performance is to changes in these configurations for the task of sentence classification. We thus conduct a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity">sensitivity analysis</a> of one-layer CNNs to explore the effect of architecture components on model performance ; our aim is to distinguish between important and comparatively inconsequential design decisions for sentence classification. We focus on one-layer CNNs (to the exclusion of more complex models) due to their comparative simplicity and strong empirical performance, which makes it a modern standard baseline method akin to Support Vector Machine (SVMs) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression">logistic regression</a>. We derive practical advice from our extensive empirical results for those interested in getting the most out of CNNs for sentence classification in real world settings.</abstract>

      <abstract>Current research in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_simplification">text simplification</a> has been hampered by two central problems : (i) the small amount of high-quality parallel simplification data available, and (ii) the lack of explicit annotations of simplification operations, such as deletions or substitutions, on existing data. While the recently introduced Newsela corpus has alleviated the first problem, simplifications still need to be learned directly from parallel text using black-box, end-to-end approaches rather than from explicit annotations. These complex-simple parallel sentence pairs often differ to such a high degree that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalization">generalization</a> becomes difficult. End-to-end models also make it hard to interpret what is actually learned from data. We propose a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_(computer_programming)">method</a> that decomposes the task of TS into its sub-problems. We devise a way to automatically identify operations in a parallel corpus and introduce a sequence-labeling approach based on these annotations. Finally, we provide insights on the types of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformation_(function)">transformations</a> that different <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpretation_(logic)">approaches</a> can model.</abstract>

      <abstract>RDF ontologies provide <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structured_data">structured data</a> on entities in many domains and continue to grow in size and diversity. While they can be useful as a starting point for generating descriptions of entities, they often miss important information about an entity that can not be captured as simple relations. In addition, generic approaches to generation from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Description_Framework">RDF</a> can not capture the unique style and content of specific domains. We describe a framework for hybrid generation of entity descriptions, which combines generation from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Description_Framework">RDF data</a> with text extracted from a corpus, and extracts unique aspects of the domain from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_corpus">corpus</a> to create domain-specific generation systems. We show that each component of our approach significantly increases the satisfaction of readers with the text across multiple applications and domains.</abstract>

      <abstract>With the advent of the Internet, the amount of Semantic Web documents that describe real-world entities and their inter-links as a set of statements have grown considerably. These descriptions are usually lengthy, which makes the utilization of the underlying entities a difficult task. Entity summarization, which aims to create summaries for real-world entities, has gained increasing attention in recent years. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic topic model, ES-LDA, that combines prior knowledge with statistical learning techniques within a single framework to create more reliable and representative summaries for entities. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by conducting extensive experiments and show that our <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model">model</a> outperforms the state-of-the-art techniques and enhances the quality of the entity summaries.</abstract>

These descriptions are useful for image / video search, etc. In this paper, we focus on procedure execution videos, in which a human makes or repairs something and propose a method for generating procedural texts from them.

However, though combining the LSTM cell, it is still a kind of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model">model</a> that extracts the structural information and almost not extracts serialization information.

      <abstract>In this work, we provide insight into three key aspects related to predicting argument convincingness. First, we explicitly display the power that text length possesses for predicting convincingness in an unsupervised setting. Second, we show that a bag-of-words embedding model posts state-of-the-art on a dataset of arguments annotated for convincingness, outperforming an SVM with numerous hand-crafted features as well as recurrent neural network models that attempt to capture semantic composition. Finally, we assess the feasibility of integrating external knowledge when predicting convincingness, as arguments are often more convincing when they contain abundant information and facts. We finish by analyzing the correlations between the various <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model">models</a> we propose.</abstract>

      <abstract>This paper tackles the task of event detection, which involves identifying and categorizing events. The previous work mainly exist two problems : (1) the traditional feature-based methods apply cross-sentence information, yet need taking a large amount of human effort to design complicated feature sets and inference rules ; (2) the representation-based methods though overcome the problem of manually extracting features, while just depend on local sentence representation. Considering local sentence context is insufficient to resolve ambiguities in identifying particular event types, therefore, we propose a novel document level Recurrent Neural Networks (DLRNN) model, which can automatically extract cross-sentence clues to improve sentence level event detection without designing complex reasoning rules. Experiment results show that our approach outperforms other state-of-the-art methods on ACE 2005 dataset without external knowledge base.</abstract>

      <abstract>Current supervised name tagging approaches are inadequate for most low-resource languages due to the lack of annotated data and actionable linguistic knowledge. All supervised learning methods (including deep neural networks (DNN)) are sensitive to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noise_(signal_processing)">noise</a> and thus they are not quite portable without massive clean annotations. We found that the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-number">F-scores</a> of DNN-based name taggers drop rapidly (20%-30 %) when we replace clean manual annotations with noisy annotations in the training data. We propose a new solution to incorporate many non-traditional language universal resources that are readily available but rarely explored in the Natural Language Processing (NLP) community, such as the World Atlas of Linguistic Structure, CIA names, PanLex and survival guides. We acquire and encode various types of non-traditional linguistic resources into a DNN name tagger. Experiments on three low-resource languages show that feeding linguistic knowledge can make DNN significantly more robust to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noise_(signal_processing)">noise</a>, achieving 8%-22 % absolute <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-score">F-score</a> gains on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tag_(metadata)">name tagging</a> without using any human annotation</abstract>

      <abstract>The recent technological shift in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_translation">machine translation</a> from statistical machine translation (SMT) to neural machine translation (NMT) raises the question of the strengths and weaknesses of NMT. In this paper, we present an analysis of NMT and SMT systems’ outputs from narrow domain English-Latvian MT systems that were trained on a rather small amount of data. We analyze <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-editing">post-edits</a> produced by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation">professional translators</a> and manually annotated errors in these outputs. Analysis of post-edits allowed us to conclude that both approaches are comparably successful, allowing for an increase in translators’ productivity, with the NMT system showing slightly worse results. Through the analysis of annotated errors, we found that NMT translations are more fluent than SMT translations. However, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error">errors</a> related to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision">accuracy</a>, especially, mistranslation and omission errors, occur more often in NMT outputs.

      <abstract>While neural machine translation (NMT) has become the new paradigm, the parameter optimization requires large-scale parallel data which is scarce in many domains and language pairs. In this paper, we address a new translation scenario in which there only exists monolingual corpora and phrase pairs. We propose a new method towards <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation">translation</a> with partially aligned sentence pairs which are derived from the phrase pairs and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_corpus">monolingual corpora</a>. To make full use of the partially aligned corpora, we adapt the conventional NMT training method in two aspects. On one hand, different generation strategies are designed for aligned and unaligned target words. On the other hand, a different <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loss_function">objective function</a> is designed to model the partially aligned parts. The experiments demonstrate that our method can achieve a relatively good result in such a translation scenario, and tiny bitexts can boost translation quality to a large extent.</abstract>

      <abstract>In this paper we introduce the problem of identifying usage expression sentences in a consumer product review. We create a human-annotated gold standard dataset of 565 reviews spanning five distinct product categories. Our <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_set">dataset</a> consists of more than 3,000 annotated sentences. We further introduce a classification system to label sentences according to whether or not they describe some usage. The system combines lexical, syntactic, and semantic features in a product-agnostic fashion to yield good <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Categorization">classification</a> performance. We show the effectiveness of our approach using importance ranking of features, error analysis, and cross-product classification experiments.</abstract>

      <abstract>Recently, encoder-decoder neural networks have shown impressive performance on many sequence-related tasks. The architecture commonly uses an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attentional_control">attentional mechanism</a> which allows the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model">model</a> to learn <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence_alignment">alignments</a> between the source and the target sequence. Most attentional mechanisms used today is based on a global attention property which requires a computation of a weighted summarization of the whole input sequence generated by encoder states. However, it is computationally expensive and often produces <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence_alignment">misalignment</a> on the longer input sequence. Furthermore, it does not fit with monotonous or left-to-right nature in several tasks, such as automatic speech recognition (ASR), grapheme-to-phoneme (G2P), etc. In this paper, we propose a novel <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attentional_control">attention mechanism</a> that has local and monotonic properties. Various ways to control those properties are also explored. Experimental results on ASR, G2P and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_translation">machine translation</a> between two languages with similar sentence structures, demonstrate that the proposed encoder-decoder model with local monotonic attention could achieve significant performance improvements and reduce the computational complexity in comparison with the one that used the standard global attention architecture.</abstract>

      <abstract>Although features of linguistic typology are a promising alternative to lexical evidence for tracing evolutionary history of languages, a large number of missing values in the dataset pose serious difficulties for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_model">statistical modeling</a>. In this paper, we combine two existing approaches to the problem : (1) the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synchrony_and_diachrony">synchronic approach</a> that focuses on interdependencies between features and (2) the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synchrony_and_diachrony">diachronic approach</a> that exploits phylogenetically- and/or spatially-related languages. Specifically, we propose a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_inference">Bayesian model</a> that (1) represents each language as a sequence of binary latent parameters encoding inter-feature dependencies and (2) relates a language’s parameters to those of its phylogenetic and spatial neighbors.

We present a novel task, Image Grounded Conversations (IGC), in which natural-sounding conversations are generated about a shared image. To benchmark progress, we introduce a new multiple reference dataset of crowd-sourced, event-centric conversations on images. IGC falls on the continuum between <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chit-chat">chit-chat</a> and goal-directed conversation models, where visual grounding constrains the topic of conversation to event-driven utterances. Experiments with models trained on social media data show that the combination of visual and textual context enhances the quality of generated conversational turns. In human evaluation, the gap between human performance and that of both neural and retrieval architectures suggests that multi-modal IGC presents an interesting challenge for dialog research.</abstract>

      <abstract>This study addresses the problem of identifying the meaning of unknown words or entities in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discourse">discourse</a> with respect to the word embedding approaches used in neural language models. We proposed a method for on-the-fly construction and exploitation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_embedding">word embeddings</a> in both the input and output layers of a neural model by tracking contexts. This extends the dynamic entity representation used in Kobayashi et al. (2016) and incorporates a copy mechanism proposed independently by Gu et al. (2016) and Gulcehre et al. In addition, we construct a new task and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_set">dataset</a> called Anonymized Language Modeling for evaluating the ability to capture <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meaning_(linguistics)">word meanings</a> while reading.

Furthermore, the experiments also demonstrate that dynamic updates of an output layer help a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model">model</a> predict reappearing entities, whereas those of an input layer are effective to predict words following reappearing entities.</abstract>

To tackle this task, recent studies have tried several <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning">deep learning methods</a> but few of them exploited the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntax">syntactic information</a>.

      <abstract>Current approaches to cross-lingual sentiment analysis try to leverage the wealth of labeled English data using bilingual lexicons, bilingual vector space embeddings, or machine translation systems. Here we show that it is possible to use a single <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_map">linear transformation</a>, with as few as 2000 word pairs, to capture fine-grained sentiment relationships between words in a cross-lingual setting. We apply these cross-lingual sentiment models to a diverse set of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Task_(project_management)">tasks</a> to demonstrate their functionality in a non-English context. By effectively leveraging English sentiment knowledge without the need for accurate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation">translation</a>, we can analyze and extract features from other languages with scarce data at a very low cost, thus making sentiment and related analyses for many languages inexpensive.</abstract>

      <abstract>Targeted sentiment analysis investigates the sentiment polarities on given target mentions from input texts. Different from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentence_(linguistics)">sentence level sentiment</a>, it offers more fine-grained knowledge on each entity mention. While early work leveraged syntactic information, recent research has used neural representation learning to induce features automatically, thereby avoiding error propagation of syntactic parsers, which are particularly severe on social media texts. We study a method to leverage syntactic information without explicitly building the parser outputs, by training an encoder-decoder structure parser model on standard syntactic treebanks, and then leveraging its hidden encoder layers when analysing tweets. Such hidden vectors do not contain explicit syntactic outputs, yet encode rich syntactic features. We use them to augment the inputs to a baseline state-of-the-art targeted sentiment classifier, observing significant improvements on various <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benchmark_(computing)">benchmark datasets</a>.

      <abstract>The sentiment aggregation problem accounts for analyzing the sentiment of a user towards various aspects / features of a product, and meaningfully assimilating the pragmatic significance of these features / aspects from an opinionated text. The current paper addresses the sentiment aggregation problem, by assigning weights to each aspect appearing in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User-generated_content">user-generated content</a>, that are proportionate to the strategic importance of the aspect in the pragmatic domain. The novelty of this paper is in computing the pragmatic significance (weight) of each aspect, using graph centrality measures (applied on domain specific ontology-graphs extracted from ConceptNet), and deeply ingraining these weights while aggregating the sentiments from opinionated text. We experiment over multiple real-life product review data. Our <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System">system</a> consistently outperforms the state of the art-by as much as a F-score of 20.39 % in one case.</abstract>

      <abstract>In this paper we propose a lightly-supervised framework to rapidly build <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_classification">text classifiers</a> for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contextual_advertising">contextual advertising</a>. Traditionally text classification techniques require labeled training documents for each predefined class. In the scenario of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contextual_advertising">contextual advertising</a>, advertisers often want to target to a specific class of webpages most relevant to their product or service, which may not be covered by a pre-trained classifier. Moreover, the advertisers are interested in whether a webpage is relevant or irrelevant. It is time-consuming to solicit the advertisers for reliable training signals for the negative class. Therefore, it is more suitable to model the problem as a one-class classification problem, in contrast to traditional classification problems where disjoint classes are defined a priori. We first apply two state-of-the-art lightly-supervised classification models, generalized expectation (GE) criteria (Druck et al., 2008) and multinomial naive Bayes (MNB) with priors (Settles, 2011) to one-class classification where the user only needs to provide a small list of labeled words for the target class. To combine the strengths of the two <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model">models</a>, we fuse them together by using MNB to automatically enrich the constraints for GE training. We also explore ensemble method to combine classifiers. On a corpus of webpages from real-time bidding requests, the proposed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_model">model</a> achieves the highest average F1 of 0.69 and closes more than half of the gap between previous state-of-the-art lightly-supervised models to a fully-supervised MaxEnt model.</abstract>

      <abstract>Despite successful applications across a broad range of NLP tasks, conditional random fields (CRFs), in particular the linear-chain variant, are only able to model local features. While this has important benefits in terms of inference tractability, it limits the ability of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model">model</a> to capture long-range dependencies between items. Attempts to extend CRFs to capture long-range dependencies have largely come at the cost of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_complexity_theory">computational complexity</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Approximate_inference">approximate inference</a>.

We present two innovations to improve the performance of these <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model">models</a>. The first innovation is the introduction of residual connections between the Stacked Recurrent Neural Network model to address the degradation problem of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning">deep neural networks</a>. The second innovation is a bias decoding mechanism that allows the trained <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System">system</a> to adapt to non-differentiable and externally computed objectives, such as the entity-based F-measure. Our work improves the state-of-the-art results for both Spanish and English languages on the standard train / development / test split of the CoNLL 2003 Shared Task NER dataset.</abstract>

      <abstract>Building a persona-based conversation agent is challenging owing to the lack of large amounts of speaker-specific conversation data for model training. This paper addresses the problem by proposing a multi-task learning approach to training neural conversation models that leverages both conversation data across speakers and other types of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data">data</a> pertaining to the speaker and speaker roles to be modeled. Experiments show that our approach leads to significant improvements over baseline model quality, generating responses that capture more precisely speakers’ traits and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Style_(sociolinguistics)">speaking styles</a>. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_model">model</a> offers the benefits of being algorithmically simple and easy to implement, and not relying on large quantities of data representing specific individual speakers.</abstract>

      <abstract>Thread disentanglement is a precursor to any high-level analysis of multiparticipant chats. Existing research approaches the problem by calculating the likelihood of two messages belonging in the same thread. Our approach leverages a newly annotated dataset to identify reply relationships. Furthermore, we explore the usage of an RNN, along with large quantities of unlabeled data, to learn semantic relationships between messages. Our proposed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipeline_(software)">pipeline</a>, which utilizes a reply classifier and an RNN to generate a set of disentangled threads, is novel and performs well against previous work.</abstract>

      <abstract>We present a major step towards the creation of the first high-coverage lexicon of polarity shifters. In this work, we bootstrap a lexicon of verbs by exploiting various <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_feature">linguistic features</a>. Polarity shifters, such as abandon, are similar to negations (e.g. not) in that they move the polarity of a phrase towards its inverse, as in abandon all hope. While there exist lists of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affirmation_and_negation">negation words</a>, creating comprehensive lists of polarity shifters is far more challenging due to their sheer number. On a sample of manually annotated verbs we examine a variety of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_(linguistics)">linguistic features</a> for this task. Then we build a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supervised_learning">supervised classifier</a> to increase <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coverage_(statistics)">coverage</a>. We show that this approach drastically reduces the annotation effort while ensuring a high-precision lexicon. We also show that our acquired knowledge of verbal polarity shifters improves phrase-level sentiment analysis.</abstract>

      <abstract>Document-level sentiment classification aims to assign the user reviews a sentiment polarity. Previous methods either just utilized the document content without consideration of user and product information, or did not comprehensively consider what roles the three kinds of information play in text modeling. In this paper, to reasonably use all the information, we present the idea that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_(computing)">user</a>, product and their combination can all influence the generation of attentions to words and sentences, when judging the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentimentality">sentiment</a> of a document. With this idea, we propose a cascading multiway attention (CMA) model, where multiple ways of using user and product information are cascaded to influence the generation of attentions on the word and sentence layers. Then, sentences and documents are well modeled by multiple representation vectors, which provide rich information for sentiment classification. Experiments on IMDB and Yelp datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_model">model</a>.</abstract>

      <abstract>Typically, relation extraction models are trained to extract instances of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology_(information_science)">relation ontology</a> using only training data from a single language. However, the concepts represented by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology_(information_science)">relation ontology</a> (e.g. ResidesIn, EmployeeOf) are language independent. The numbers of annotated examples available for a given <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology_(information_science)">ontology</a> vary between languages. For example, there are far fewer annotated examples in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_language">Spanish</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_language">Japanese</a> than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language">English</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_language">Chinese</a>. Furthermore, using only language-specific training data results in the need to manually annotate equivalently large amounts of training for each new language a system encounters. We propose a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning">deep neural network</a> to learn transferable, discriminative bilingual representation. Experiments on the ACE 2005 multilingual training corpus demonstrate that the joint training process results in significant improvement in relation classification performance over the monolingual counterparts. The learnt representation is discriminative and transferable between languages. When using 10 % (25 K English words, or 30 K Chinese characters) of the training data, our approach results in doubling F1 compared to a monolingual baseline. We achieve comparable performance to the monolingual system trained with 250 K English words (or 300 K Chinese characters) With 50 % of training data.</abstract>

Therefore, in this paper, we explore to predict users’ imminent dissatisfactions caused by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_agent">intelligent agents</a> by analysing the existing utterances in the dialogue sessions. To our knowledge, this is the first work focusing on this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Task_(project_management)">task</a>. Several possible factors that trigger <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotion">negative emotions</a> are modelled. A relation sequence model (RSM) is proposed to encode the sequence of appropriateness of current response with respect to the earlier utterances. The experimental results show that the proposed structure is effective in modelling emotional risk (possibility of negative feedback) than existing conversation modelling approaches. Besides, strategies of obtaining distance supervision data for pre-training are also discussed in this work. Balanced sampling with respect to the last response in the distance supervision data are shown to be reliable for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_augmentation">data augmentation</a>.</abstract>

      <abstract>There are several dialog frameworks which allow manual specification of intents and rule based dialog flow. The rule based framework provides good control to dialog designers at the expense of being more time consuming and laborious. The job of a dialog designer can be reduced if we could identify pairs of user intents and corresponding responses automatically from prior conversations between users and agents. In this paper we propose an approach to find these frequent user utterances (which serve as examples for intents) and corresponding agent responses. We propose a novel SimCluster algorithm that extends standard <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering">K-means algorithm</a> to simultaneously cluster user utterances and agent utterances by taking their adjacency information into account. The method also aligns these <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluster_analysis">clusters</a> to provide pairs of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intention">intents</a> and response groups. We compare our results with those produced by using simple Kmeans clustering on a real dataset and observe upto 10 % absolute improvement in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-number">F1-scores</a>. Through our experiments on synthetic dataset, we show that our <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm">algorithm</a> gains more advantage over K-means algorithm when the data has large variance.</abstract>

      <abstract>One of the major drawbacks of modularized task-completion dialogue systems is that each <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_programming">module</a> is trained individually, which presents several challenges. For example, downstream modules are affected by earlier <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_programming">modules</a>, and the performance of the entire <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System">system</a> is not robust to the accumulated errors. This paper presents a novel end-to-end learning framework for task-completion dialogue systems to tackle such issues. Our neural dialogue system can directly interact with a structured database to assist users in accessing information and accomplishing certain tasks. The reinforcement learning based dialogue manager offers robust capabilities to handle <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noise">noises</a> caused by other components of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialogue_system">dialogue system</a>. Our experiments in a movie-ticket booking domain show that our end-to-end system not only outperforms modularized dialogue system baselines for both objective and subjective evaluation, but also is robust to noises as demonstrated by several systematic experiments with different error granularity and rates specific to the language understanding module.</abstract>

      <abstract>Several studies have demonstrated how language models of user attributes, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personality">personality</a>, can be built by using the Facebook language of social media users in conjunction with their responses to psychology questionnaires. It is challenging to apply these models to make general predictions about attributes of communities, such as personality distributions across US counties, because it requires 1. the potentially inavailability of the original training data because of privacy and ethical regulations, 2. adapting Facebook language models to Twitter language without retraining the model, and 3. adapting from users to county-level collections of tweets. We propose a two-step algorithm, Target Side Domain Adaptation (TSDA) for such domain adaptation when no labeled Twitter / county data is available. TSDA corrects for the different word distributions between <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter">Twitter</a> and for the varying word distributions across counties by adjusting target side word frequencies ; no changes to the trained model are made. In the case of predicting the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_personality_traits">Big Five county-level personality traits</a>, TSDA outperforms a state-of-the-art domain adaptation method, gives county-level predictions that have fewer extreme outliers, higher year-to-year stability, and higher correlation with county-level outcomes.</abstract>

This system significantly outperforms hate speech detection systems that are trained in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supervised_learning">supervised manner</a> using manually annotated data. Applying this model on a large quantity of tweets collected before, after, and on election day reveals motivations and patterns of inflammatory language.</abstract>

      <abstract>Concept-map-based multi-document summarization is a variant of traditional <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_summarization">summarization</a> that produces structured summaries in the form of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concept_map">concept maps</a>. In this work, we propose a new <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_model">model</a> for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Task_(project_management)">task</a> that addresses several issues in previous methods. It learns to identify and merge coreferent concepts to reduce redundancy, determines their importance with a strong <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supervised_learning">supervised model</a> and finds an optimal summary concept map via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_linear_programming">integer linear programming</a>. It is also computationally more efficient than previous methods, allowing us to summarize larger document sets. We evaluate the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model">model</a> on two datasets, finding that it outperforms several approaches from previous work.</abstract>

      <abstract>Existing work for abstractive multidocument summarization utilise existing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phrase_structure">phrase structures</a> directly extracted from input documents to generate summary sentences. These methods can suffer from lack of consistence and coherence in merging phrases. We introduce a novel approach for abstractive multidocument summarization through partial dependency tree extraction, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_recombination">recombination</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linearization">linearization</a>. The method entrusts the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_summarization">summarizer</a> to generate its own topically coherent sequential structures from scratch for effective communication. Results on TAC 2011, DUC-2004 and 2005 show that our system gives competitive results compared with state of the art abstractive summarization approaches in the literature. We also achieve competitive results in linguistic quality assessed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation">human evaluators</a>.</abstract>

      <abstract>Cross-lingual open information extraction is the task of distilling facts from the source language into representations in the target language. We propose a novel encoder-decoder model for this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_solving">problem</a>. It employs a novel selective decoding mechanism, which explicitly models the sequence labeling process as well as the sequence generation process on the decoder side. Compared to a standard encoder-decoder model, selective decoding significantly increases the performance on a Chinese-English cross-lingual open IE dataset by 3.87-4.49 BLEU and 1.91-5.92 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-number">F1</a>. We also extend our approach to low-resource scenarios, and gain promising improvement.</abstract>

      <abstract>This paper improves on several aspects of a sieve-based event ordering architecture, CAEVO (Chambers et al., 2014), which creates globally consistent temporal relations between events and time expressions. First, we examine the usage of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_embedding">word embeddings</a> and semantic role features. With the incorporation of these new features, we demonstrate a 5 % relative F1 gain over our replicated version of CAEVO. Second, we reformulate the architecture’s sieve-based inference algorithm as a prediction reranking method that approximately optimizes a scoring function computed using classifier precisions. Within this prediction reranking framework, we propose an alternative scoring function, showing an 8.8 % relative gain over the original CAEVO. We further include an in-depth analysis of one of the main datasets that is used to evaluate temporal classifiers, and we show how despite using the densest corpus, there is still a danger of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overfitting">overfitting</a>. While this paper focuses on temporal ordering, its results are applicable to other areas that use sieve-based architectures.</abstract>

      <abstract>Previous open Relation Extraction (open RE) approaches mainly rely on linguistic patterns and constraints to extract important relational triples from large-scale corpora. However, they lack of abilities to cover diverse relation expressions or measure the relative importance of candidate triples within a sentence. It is also challenging to name the relation type of a relational triple merely based on context words, which could limit the usefulness of open RE in downstream applications. We propose a novel importance-based open RE approach by exploiting the global structure of a dependency tree to extract salient triples. We design an unsupervised relation type naming method by grounding relational triples to a large-scale Knowledge Base (KB) schema, leveraging KB triples and weighted context words associated with relational triples. Experiments on the English Slot Filling 2013 dataset demonstrate that our <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methodology">approach</a> achieves 8.1 % higher <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-score">F-score</a> over state-of-the-art open RE methods.</abstract>

      <abstract>Genetic information in the literature has been extensively looked into for the purpose of discovering the etiology of a disease. As the gene-disease relation is sensitive to external factors, their identification is important to study a disease. Environmental influences, which are usually called Gene-Environment interaction (GxE), have been considered as important factors and have extensively been researched in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology">biology</a>. Nevertheless, there is still a lack of systems for automatic GxE extraction from the biomedical literature due to new challenges : (1) there are no preprocessing tools and corpora for GxE, (2) expressions of GxE are often quite implicit, and (3) document-level comprehension is usually required. We propose to overcome these challenges with neural network models and show that a modified sequence-to-sequence model with a static RNN decoder produces a good performance in GxE recognition.</abstract>

One challenging issue in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massive_open_online_course">MOOCs</a> is how to design effective and fine-grained course concepts such that students with different backgrounds can grasp the essence of the course.

      <abstract>Progress in natural language interfaces to databases (NLIDB) has been slow mainly due to linguistic issues (such as language ambiguity) and domain portability. Moreover, the lack of a large corpus to be used as a standard benchmark has made data-driven approaches difficult to develop and compare. In this paper, we revisit the problem of NLIDBs and recast it as a sequence translation problem. To this end, we introduce a large dataset extracted from the Stack Exchange Data Explorer website, which can be used for training neural natural language interfaces for databases. We also report encouraging baseline results on a smaller manually annotated test corpus, obtained using an attention-based sequence-to-sequence neural network.</abstract>

We present a general <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy">strategy</a> to automatically generate one or more sentential hypotheses based on an input sentence and pre-existing manual semantic annotations. The resulting suite of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_set">datasets</a> enables us to probe a statistical RTE model’s performance on different aspects of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantics">semantics</a>. We demonstrate the value of this approach by investigating the behavior of a popular neural network RTE model.</abstract>

      <abstract>Hierarchical attention networks have recently achieved remarkable performance for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_classification">document classification</a> in a given language. However, when multilingual document collections are considered, training such <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model">models</a> separately for each language entails linear parameter growth and lack of cross-language transfer. Learning a single multilingual model with fewer parameters is therefore a challenging but potentially beneficial objective. To this end, we propose multilingual hierarchical attention networks for learning document structures, with shared encoders and/or shared attention mechanisms across languages, using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-task_learning">multi-task learning</a> and an aligned semantic space as input. We evaluate the proposed models on multilingual document classification with disjoint label sets, on a large dataset which we provide, with 600k news documents in 8 languages, and 5k labels. The multilingual models outperform monolingual ones in low-resource as well as full-resource settings, and use fewer parameters, thus confirming their computational efficiency and the utility of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_transfer">cross-language transfer</a>.</abstract>

      <abstract>This paper proposes a new attention mechanism for neural machine translation (NMT) based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which is inspired by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CKY_algorithm">CKY algorithm</a>. The proposed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention">attention</a> represents every possible combination of source words (e.g., phrases and structures) through CNNs, which imitates the CKY table in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm">algorithm</a>. NMT, incorporating the proposed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention">attention</a>, decodes a target sentence on the basis of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention">attention scores</a> of the hidden states of CNNs. The proposed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention">attention</a> enables NMT to capture <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence_alignment">alignments</a> from underlying structures of a source sentence without <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentence_parsing">sentence parsing</a>. The evaluations on the Asian Scientific Paper Excerpt Corpus (ASPEC) English-Japanese translation task show that the proposed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention">attention</a> gains 0.66 points in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BLEU">BLEU</a>.</abstract>

      <abstract>Our paper addresses the problem of annotation projection for semantic role labeling for resource-poor languages using supervised annotations from a resource-rich language through parallel data. We propose a transfer method that employs information from source and target syntactic dependencies as well as word alignment density to improve the quality of an iterative bootstrapping method. Our experiments yield a 3.5 absolute labeled F-score improvement over a standard annotation projection method.</abstract>

We define a fine-grained feature set based on the hand-coded syllables and train a logistic regression classifier on labeled syllables, expecting to find the discriminative features from the trained <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_classification">classifier</a>. We also perform pseudo active learning to investigate the applicability of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_learning">active learning</a> in analyzing syllables.

      <abstract>Word embeddings are a relatively new addition to the modern NLP researcher’s toolkit. However, unlike other <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool">tools</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_embedding">word embeddings</a> are used in a black box manner. There are very few studies regarding various <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperparameter">hyperparameters</a>. One such <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperparameter">hyperparameter</a> is the dimension of word embeddings. They are rather decided based on a rule of thumb : in the range 50 to 300. In this paper, we show that the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimension_(vector_space)">dimension</a> should instead be chosen based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corpus_linguistics">corpus statistics</a>. More specifically, we show that the number of pairwise equidistant words of the corpus vocabulary (as defined by some distance / similarity metric) gives a lower bound on the the number of dimensions, and going below this bound results in degradation of quality of learned word embeddings. Through our evaluations on standard word embedding evaluation tasks, we show that for dimensions higher than or equal to the bound, we get better results as compared to the ones below it.</abstract>

We refer to our proposed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_(computer_programming)">method</a> as Input-to-Output Gate (IOG). IOG has an extremely simple structure, and thus, can be easily combined with any RNN language models. Our experiments on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penn_Treebank">Penn Treebank</a> and WikiText-2 datasets demonstrate that IOG consistently boosts the performance of several different types of current topline RNN language models.</abstract>

      <abstract>Word segmentation is crucial in natural language processing tasks for unsegmented languages. In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_language">Japanese</a>, many out-of-vocabulary words appear in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katakana">phonetic syllabary katakana</a>, making segmentation more difficult due to the lack of clues found in mixed script settings.

      <abstract>Low-resource named entity recognition is still an open problem in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing">NLP</a>. Most state-of-the-art systems require tens of thousands of annotated sentences in order to obtain high performance. However, for most of the world’s languages it is unfeasible to obtain such annotation. In this paper, we present a transfer learning scheme, whereby we train character-level neural CRFs to predict <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Named-entity_recognition">named entities</a> for both high-resource languages and low-resource languages jointly. Learning character representations for multiple related languages allows <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_transfer">knowledge transfer</a> from the high-resource languages to the low-resource ones, improving F1 by up to 9.8 points.</abstract>

Specifically, we introduce seven types of alignment-based features computed on the basis of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_embedding">word embeddings</a> and paraphrase lexicons.

      <abstract>Word embeddings learned from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_corpus">text corpus</a> can be improved by injecting knowledge from external resources, while at the same time also specializing them for similarity or relatedness. These knowledge resources (like WordNet, Paraphrase Database) may not exist for all languages. In this work we introduce a method to inject <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_embedding">word embeddings</a> of a language with knowledge resource of another language by leveraging bilingual embeddings. First we improve word embeddings of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_language">German</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_language">Italian</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language">French</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_language">Spanish</a> using resources of English and test them on variety of word similarity tasks. Then we demonstrate the utility of our method by creating improved embeddings for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urdu">Urdu and Telugu languages</a> using Hindi WordNet, beating the previously established baseline for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urdu">Urdu</a>.</abstract>

      <abstract>The research trend in Japanese predicate-argument structure (PAS) analysis is shifting from pointwise prediction models with local features to global models designed to search for globally optimal solutions. However, the existing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_circulation_model">global models</a> tend to employ only relatively simple local features ; therefore, the overall performance gains are rather limited. The importance of designing a local model is demonstrated in this study by showing that the performance of a sophisticated local model can be considerably improved with recent feature embedding methods and a feature combination learning based on a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_network">neural network</a>, outperforming the state-of-the-art global models in F1 on a common benchmark dataset.</abstract>

      <abstract>When giving descriptions, speakers often signify object shape or size with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_gestures">hand gestures</a>. Such so-called ‘iconic’ gestures represent their meaning through their relevance to referents in the verbal content, rather than having a conventional form. The gesture form on its own is often ambiguous, and the aspect of the referent that it highlights is constrained by what the language makes salient. We show how the verbal content guides gesture interpretation through a computational model that frames the task as a multi-label classification task that maps multimodal utterances to semantic categories, using annotated human-human data.</abstract>

      <abstract>Humans process language word by word and construct partial linguistic structures on the fly before the end of the sentence is perceived. Inspired by this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognition">cognitive ability</a>, incremental algorithms for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing">natural language processing tasks</a> have been proposed and demonstrated promising performance. For discourse relation (DR) parsing, however, it is not yet clear to what extent humans can recognize DRs incrementally, because the latent ‘nodes’ of discourse structure can span clauses and sentences. To answer this question, this work investigates incrementality in discourse processing based on a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_corpus">corpus</a> annotated with DR signals. We find that DRs are dominantly signaled at the boundary between the two constituent discourse units. The findings complement existing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psycholinguistics">psycholinguistic theories</a> on expectation in discourse processing and provide direction for incremental discourse parsing.</abstract>

      <abstract>Language understanding (LU) and dialogue policy learning are two essential components in conversational systems. Human-human dialogues are not well-controlled and often random and unpredictable due to their own goals and speaking habits. This paper proposes a role-based contextual model to consider different speaker roles independently based on the various speaking patterns in the multi-turn dialogues. The experiments on the benchmark dataset show that the proposed role-based model successfully learns role-specific behavioral patterns for contextual encoding and then significantly improves <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural-language_understanding">language understanding</a> and dialogue policy learning tasks.</abstract>

      <abstract>Neural conversation systems, typically using sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models, are showing promising progress recently. However, traditional seq2seq suffer from a severe weakness : during beam search decoding, they tend to rank universal replies at the top of the candidate list, resulting in the lack of diversity among candidate replies. Maximum Marginal Relevance (MMR) is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranking_(statistics)">ranking algorithm</a> that has been widely used for subset selection. In this paper, we propose the MMR-BS decoding method, which incorporates MMR into the beam search (BS) process of seq2seq. The MMR-BS method improves the diversity of generated replies without sacrificing their high relevance with the user-issued query. Experiments show that our proposed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model">model</a> achieves the best performance among other comparison methods.</abstract>

We show that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis">regression models</a> with reference-based and linguistic features considerably outperform the baselines across all the rubrics.

Specifically, after extracting templates and learning writing knowledge from attribute-description parallel data, we use the learned knowledge to decide what to say and how to say for product description generation. To evaluate accuracy and fluency for the generated descriptions, in addition to BLEU and Recall, we propose to measure what to say (in terms of attribute coverage) and to measure how to say (by attribute-specified generation) separately. Experimental results show that our <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_framework">framework</a> is effective.</abstract>

      <abstract>Ideally a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_(mathematics)">metric</a> evaluating an abstract system summary should represent the extent to which the system-generated summary approximates the semantic inference conceived by the reader using a human-written reference summary. Most of the previous approaches relied upon word or syntactic sub-sequence overlap to evaluate system-generated summaries. Such <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_(mathematics)">metrics</a> can not evaluate the summary at semantic inference level. Through this work we introduce the metric of Semantic Similarity for Abstractive Summarization (SSAS), which leverages natural language inference and paraphrasing techniques to frame a novel approach to evaluate system summaries at semantic inference level. SSAS is based upon a weighted composition of quantities representing the level of agreement, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contradiction">contradiction</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_(probability_theory)">independence</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paraphrase">paraphrasing</a>, and optionally ROUGE score between a system-generated and a human-written summary.</abstract>

      <abstract>Following Gillick and Favre (2009), a lot of work about extractive summarization has modeled this task by associating two contrary constraints : one aims at maximizing the coverage of the summary with respect to its information content while the other represents its size limit. In this context, the notion of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redundancy_(linguistics)">redundancy</a> is only implicitly taken into account. In this article, we extend the framework defined by Gillick and Favre (2009) by examining how and to what extent integrating semantic sentence similarity into an update summarization system can improve its results.

      <abstract>Embedding based approaches are shown to be effective for solving simple Question Answering (QA) problems in recent works. The major drawback of current approaches is that they look only at the similarity (constraint) between a question and a head, relation pair. Due to the absence of tail (answer) in the questions, these <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model">models</a> often require paraphrase datasets to obtain adequate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embedding">embeddings</a>. In this paper, we propose a dual constraint model which exploits the embeddings obtained by Trans * family of algorithms to solve the simple QA problem without using any additional resources such as paraphrase datasets. The results obtained prove that the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embedding">embeddings</a> learned using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constraint_(mathematics)">dual constraints</a> are better than those with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constraint_(mathematics)">single constraint models</a> having similar architecture.</abstract>

      <abstract>This paper investigates the problem of answering compositional factoid questions over knowledge bases (KB) under efficiency constraints. The method, called TIPI, (i) decomposes compositional questions, (ii) predicts answer types for individual sub-questions, (iii) reasons over the compatibility of joint types, and finally, (iv) formulates compositional SPARQL queries respecting type constraints. TIPI’s answer type predictor is trained using distant supervision, and exploits lexical, syntactic and embedding-based features to compute context- and hierarchy-aware candidate answer types for an input question. Experiments on a recent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benchmark_(computing)">benchmark</a> show that TIPI results in state-of-the-art performance under the real-world assumption that only a single SPARQL query can be executed over the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilobyte">KB</a>, and substantial reduction in the number of queries in the more general case.</abstract>

      <abstract>Focusing on the task of identifying event temporal status, we find that events directly or indirectly governing the target event in a dependency tree are most important contexts. Therefore, we extract dependency chains containing context events and use them as input in neural network models, which consistently outperform previous models using local context words as input. Visualization verifies that the dependency chain representation can effectively capture the context events which are closely related to the target event and play key roles in predicting event temporal status.</abstract>

      <abstract>Empathy captures one’s ability to correlate with and understand others’ emotional states and experiences. Messages with empathetic content are considered as one of the main advantages for joining online health communities due to their potential to improve people’s moods. Unfortunately, to this date, no computational studies exist that automatically identify empathetic messages in online health communities. We propose a combination of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks, and show that the proposed model outperforms each individual model (CNN and LSTM) as well as several baselines.</abstract>

      <abstract>Automatic fake news detection is an important, yet very challenging topic. Traditional <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methodology">methods</a> using lexical features have only very limited success. This paper proposes a novel method to incorporate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_speaking">speaker profiles</a> into an attention based LSTM model for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fake_news">fake news detection</a>. Speaker profiles contribute to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_model">model</a> in two ways. One is to include <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Them">them</a> in the attention model. The other includes <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Latin_phrases_(M)">them</a> as additional input data. By adding speaker profiles such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_party">party affiliation</a>, speaker title, location and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_history">credit history</a>, our <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model">model</a> outperforms the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State-of-the-art">state-of-the-art method</a> by 14.5 % in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision">accuracy</a> using a benchmark fake news detection dataset. This proves that speaker profiles provide valuable information to validate the credibility of news articles.</abstract>

      <abstract>In this study, we investigated the effectiveness of augmented data for encoder-decoder-based neural normalization models. Attention based encoder-decoder models are greatly effective in generating many natural languages. % such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_translation">machine translation</a> or machine summarization. In general, we have to prepare for a large amount of training data to train an encoder-decoder model. Unlike <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_translation">machine translation</a>, there are few training data for text-normalization tasks. In this paper, we propose two <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methodology">methods</a> for generating augmented data. The experimental results with Japanese dialect normalization indicate that our methods are effective for an encoder-decoder model and achieve higher BLEU score than that of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseline_(typography)">baselines</a>. We also investigated the oracle performance and revealed that there is sufficient room for improving an encoder-decoder model.</abstract>

      <abstract>We propose a hierarchical neural network model for language variety identification that integrates information from a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_network">social network</a>. Recently, language variety identification has enjoyed heightened popularity as an advanced task of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_identification">language identification</a>. The proposed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_model">model</a> uses additional texts from a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_network">social network</a> to improve language variety identification from two perspectives. First, they are used to introduce the effects of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homophily">homophily</a>. Secondly, they are used as expanded training data for shared layers of the proposed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model">model</a>. By introducing information from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_social_networking_websites">social networks</a>, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model">model</a> improved its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision">accuracy</a> by 1.67-5.56.

Furthermore, we analyzed the cases of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portuguese_language">Portuguese</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic">Arabic</a> when the model showed weak performances, and found that the effect of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homophily">homophily</a> is likely to be weak due to sparsity and noises compared to languages with the strong performances.</abstract>

      <abstract>Training efficiency is one of the main problems for Neural Machine Translation (NMT). Deep networks need for very large data as well as many training iterations to achieve state-of-the-art performance. This results in very high <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_cost">computation cost</a>, slowing down research and industrialisation. In this paper, we propose to alleviate this problem with several training methods based on data boosting and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrapping_(statistics)">bootstrap</a> with no modifications to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_network">neural network</a>. It imitates the learning process of humans, which typically spend more time when learning difficult concepts than easier ones. We experiment on an English-French translation task showing accuracy improvements of up to 1.63 BLEU while saving 20 % of training time.</abstract>

      <abstract>We investigate pivot-based translation between related languages in a low resource, phrase-based SMT setting. We show that a subword-level pivot-based SMT model using a related pivot language is substantially better than word and morpheme-level pivot models. It is also highly competitive with the best direct translation model, which is encouraging as no direct source-target training corpus is used. We also show that combining multiple related language pivot models can rival a direct translation model. Thus, the use of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subword">subwords</a> as translation units coupled with multiple related pivot languages can compensate for the lack of a direct parallel corpus.</abstract>

      <abstract>In this paper, we propose a neural machine translation (NMT) with a key-value attention mechanism on the source-side encoder. The key-value attention mechanism separates the source-side content vector into two types of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_data_storage">memory</a> known as the key and the value. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_(cryptography)">key</a> is used for calculating the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention">attention distribution</a>, and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(computer_science)">value</a> is used for encoding the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Context_(language_use)">context representation</a>. Experiments on three different tasks indicate that our <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model">model</a> outperforms an NMT model with a conventional <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attentional_control">attention mechanism</a>. Furthermore, we perform experiments with a conventional NMT framework, in which a part of the initial value of a weight matrix is set to zero so that the matrix is as the same initial-state as the key-value attention mechanism. As a result, we obtain comparable results with the key-value attention mechanism without changing the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_circuit">network structure</a>.</abstract>

However, there is little non-English corpora, particular for ones in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_language">Chinese</a>.

      <abstract>Automatic analysis of curriculum vitae (CVs) of applicants is of tremendous importance in recruitment scenarios. The semi-structuredness of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curriculum_vitae">CVs</a>, however, makes CV processing a challenging task. We propose a solution towards transforming CVs to follow a unified structure, thereby, paving ways for smoother CV analysis. The problem of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restructuring">restructuring</a> is posed as a section relabeling problem, where each section of a given <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_type_definition">CV</a> gets reassigned to a predefined label.

      <abstract>While <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language">language</a> conveys meaning largely symbolically, actual communication acts typically contain iconic elements as well : People gesture while they speak, or may even draw sketches while explaining something. Image retrieval prima facie seems like a task that could profit from combined symbolic and iconic reference, but it is typically set up to work either from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language">language</a> only, or via (iconic) sketches with no verbal contribution. Using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_model">model of grounded language semantics</a> and a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_model">model of sketch-to-image mapping</a>, we show that adding even very reduced iconic information to a verbal image description improves <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recall_(memory)">recall</a>. Verbal descriptions paired with fully detailed sketches still perform better than these <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sketch_comedy">sketches</a> alone. We see these results as supporting the assumption that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_user_interface">natural user interfaces</a> should respond to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multimodal_interaction">multimodal input</a>, where possible, rather than just <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing">language</a> alone.</abstract>

It then constructs document embeddings from the character embeddings based on Hierarchical Attention Networks, which represent the documents based on attention mechanisms from a character level to a sentence level. The document embeddings are finally used to predict the labels of documents. Our method provides a way to exploit visual features of characters in languages with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideogram">ideograms</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logogram">logograms</a>. In the experiments, our method achieved an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision">accuracy</a> comparable to a character embedding-based model while our method has much fewer parameters since it does not need to keep embeddings of thousands of characters.</abstract>

      <abstract>Complex word identification (CWI) is an important task in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accessibility">text accessibility</a>. However, due to the scarcity of CWI datasets, previous studies have only addressed this problem on Wikipedia sentences and have solely taken into account the needs of non-native English speakers. We collect a new CWI dataset (CWIG3G2) covering three text genres News, WikiNews, and Wikipedia) annotated by both native and non-native English speakers. Unlike previous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_set">datasets</a>, we cover <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phrase">single words</a>, as well as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phrase">complex phrases</a>, and present them for judgment in a paragraph context. We present the first study on cross-genre and cross-group CWI, showing measurable influences in native language and genre types.</abstract>

      <abstract>We propose a novel, data-driven, and stylistically consistent dialog response generation system. To create a user-friendly system, it is crucial to make generated responses not only appropriate but also stylistically consistent. For leaning both the properties effectively, our proposed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_framework">framework</a> has two training stages inspired by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_learning">transfer learning</a>. First, we train the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model">model</a> to generate appropriate responses, and then we ensure that the responses have a specific style. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method produces stylistically consistent responses while maintaining the appropriateness of the responses learned in a general domain.</abstract>

      <abstract>We propose a submodular function-based summarization system which integrates three important measures namely importance, coverage, and non-redundancy to detect the important sentences for the summary. We design monotone and submodular functions which allow us to apply an efficient and scalable <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greedy_algorithm">greedy algorithm</a> to obtain informative and well-covered summaries. In addition, we integrate two abstraction-based methods namely sentence compression and merging for generating an abstractive sentence set. We design our summarization models for both generic and query-focused summarization. Experimental results on DUC-2004 and DUC-2007 datasets show that our generic and query-focused summarizers have outperformed the state-of-the-art summarization systems in terms of ROUGE-1 and ROUGE-2 recall and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-measure">F-measure</a>.</abstract>

      <abstract>Relations are expressed in many domains such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News_agency">newswire</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog">weblogs</a> and phone conversations. Trained on a source domain, a relation extractor’s performance degrades when applied to target domains other than the source. A common yet labor-intensive method for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_adaptation">domain adaptation</a> is to construct a target-domain-specific labeled dataset for adapting the extractor. In response, we present an unsupervised domain adaptation method which only requires labels from the source domain. Our method is a joint model consisting of a CNN-based relation classifier and a domain-adversarial classifier. The two <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Component-based_software_engineering">components</a> are optimized jointly to learn a domain-independent representation for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction">prediction</a> on the target domain.

      <abstract>This paper explores the idea of robot editors, automated proofreaders that enable journalists to improve the quality of their articles. We propose a novel neural model of multi-task learning that both generates proofread sentences and predicts the editing operations required to rewrite the source sentences and create the proofread ones. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model">model</a> is trained using logs of the revisions made professional editors revising draft newspaper articles written by journalists. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our multi-task learning approach and the potential value of using revision logs for this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Task_(project_management)">task</a>.</abstract>

      <abstract>What can you do with multiple noisy versions of the same text? We present a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method">method</a> which generates a single <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus_decision-making">consensus</a> between multi-parallel corpora. By maximizing a function of linguistic features between word pairs, we jointly learn a single corpus-wide multiway alignment : a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus_decision-making">consensus</a> between 27 versions of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible_translations_into_English">English Bible</a>. We additionally produce English paraphrases, word-level distributions of tags, and consensus dependency parses. Our <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methodology">method</a> is language independent and applicable to any multi-parallel corpora. Given the Bible’s unique role as alignable bitext for over 800 of the world’s languages, this consensus alignment and resulting resources offer value for multilingual annotation projection, and also shed potential insights into the Bible itself.</abstract>

      <abstract>According to the analysis of Cambridge Learner Corpus, using a wrong verb is the most common type of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_error">grammatical errors</a>. This paper describes Verb Replacer, a system for detecting and correcting potential verb errors in a given sentence. In our approach, alternative verbs are considered to replace the verb based on an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_detection_and_correction">error-annotated corpus</a> and verb-object collocations. The method involves applying <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis">regression</a> on channel models, parsing the sentence, identifying the verbs, retrieving a small set of alternative verbs, and evaluating each alternative. Our method combines and improves channel and language models, resulting in high <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recall_(memory)">recall</a> of detecting and correcting verb misuse.</abstract>

      <abstract>In this paper, we present a method for extracting Synchronous Grammar Patterns (SGPs) from a given parallel corpus in order to assisted second language learners in writing. A grammar pattern consists of a head word (verb, noun, or adjective) and its syntactic environment. A synchronous grammar pattern describes a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammar">grammar pattern</a> in the target language (e.g., <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language">English</a>) and its counterpart in an other language (e.g., <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandarin_Chinese">Mandarin</a>), serving the purpose of native language support. Our method involves identifying the grammar patterns in the target language, aligning these <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern_recognition">patterns</a> with the target language patterns, and finally filtering valid SGPs. The extracted SGPs with examples are then used to develop a prototype writing assistant system, called WriteAhead / bilingual. Evaluation on a set of randomly selected SGPs shows that our <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System">system</a> provides satisfactory writing suggestions for English as a Second Language (ESL) learners.</abstract>

      <abstract>In this paper, we propose an idea of ondemand knowledge validation and fulfill the idea through an interactive Question-Answering (QA) game system, which is named Guess What. An object (e.g. dog) is first randomly chosen by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System">system</a>, and then a user can repeatedly ask the system questions in natural language to guess what the object is. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System">system</a> would respond with yes / no along with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval">confidence score</a>. Some useful hints can also be given if needed. The proposed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_framework">framework</a> provides a pioneering example of on-demand knowledge validation in dialog environment to address such needs in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_agent">AI agents / chatbots</a>. Moreover, the released log data that the system gathered can be used to identify the most critical concepts / attributes of an existing knowledge base, which reflects human’s cognition about the world.</abstract>

      <abstract>This paper presents the IJCNLP 2017 shared task on Dimensional Sentiment Analysis for Chinese Phrases (DSAP) which seeks to identify a real-value sentiment score of Chinese single words and multi-word phrases in the both valence and arousal dimensions. Valence represents the degree of pleasant and unpleasant (or positive and negative) feelings, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arousal">arousal</a> represents the degree of excitement and calm. Of the 19 teams registered for this shared task for two-dimensional sentiment analysis, 13 submitted results.

The task is to diagnose four types of grammatical errors which are redundant words (R), missing words (M), bad word selection (S) and disordered words (W). We treat the task as a sequence tagging problem and design some handcraft features to solve it. Our system is mainly based on the LSTM-CRF model and 3 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ensemble_learning">ensemble strategies</a> are applied to improve the performance. At the identification level and the position level our <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System">system</a> gets the highest F1 scores. At the position level, which is the most difficult level, we perform best on all metrics.</abstract>

      <abstract>Predicting valence-arousal ratings for words and phrases is very useful for constructing affective resources for dimensional sentiment analysis. Since the existing valence-arousal resources of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_language">Chinese</a> are mainly in word-level and there is a lack of phrase-level ones, the Dimensional Sentiment Analysis for Chinese Phrases (DSAP) task aims to predict the valence-arousal ratings for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_language">Chinese affective words and phrases</a> automatically. In this task, we propose an approach using a densely connected LSTM network and word features to identify dimensional sentiment on valence and arousal for words and phrases jointly. We use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_embedding">word embedding</a> as major feature and choose part of speech (POS) and word clusters as additional features to train the dense LSTM network. The evaluation results of our submissions (1st and 2nd in average performance) validate the effectiveness of our system to predict valence and arousal dimensions for Chinese words and phrases.</abstract>

      <abstract>The Review Opinion Diversification (Revopid-2017) shared task focuses on selecting top-k reviews from a set of reviews for a particular product based on a specific criteria. In this paper, we describe our approaches and results for modeling the ranking of reviews based on their usefulness score, this being the first of the three subtasks under this shared task. Instead of posing this as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis">regression problem</a>, we modeled this as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_classification">classification task</a> where we want to identify whether a review is useful or not. We employed a bi-directional LSTM to represent each review and is used with a softmax layer to predict the usefulness score. We chose the review with highest usefulness score, then find its cosine similarity score with rest of the reviews. This is done in order to ensure diversity in the selection of top-k reviews. On the top-5 list prediction, we finished 3rd while in top-10 list one, we are placed 2nd in the shared task. We have discussed the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model">model</a> and the results in detail in the paper.</abstract>

      <abstract>The ability to automatically and accurately process <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_service">customer feedback</a> is a necessity in the private sector. Unfortunately, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_feedback">customer feedback</a> can be one of the most difficult types of data to work with due to the sheer volume and variety of services, products, languages, and cultures that comprise the customer experience. In order to address this issue, our team built a suite of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_classification">classifiers</a> trained on a four-language, multi-label corpus released as part of the shared task on Customer Feedback Analysis at IJCNLP 2017. In addition to standard text preprocessing, we translated each <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_set">dataset</a> into each other language to increase the size of the training datasets. Additionally, we also used <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_embedding">word embeddings</a> in our feature engineering step. Ultimately, we trained classifiers using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression">Logistic Regression</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_forest">Random Forest</a>, and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Recurrent Neural Networks. Overall, we achieved a Macro-Average F-score between 48.7 % and 56.0 % for the four languages and ranked 3/12 for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language">English</a>, 3/7 for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_language">Spanish</a>, 1/8 for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language">French</a>, and 2/7 for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_language">Japanese</a>.</abstract>

      <abstract>We describe the work of a team from the ADAPT Centre in Ireland in addressing automatic answer selection for the Multi-choice Question Answering in Examinations shared task. The system is based on a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression">logistic regression</a> over the string similarities between question, answer, and additional text. We obtain the highest grade out of six <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System">systems</a> : 48.7 % <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision">accuracy</a> on a validation set (vs. a baseline of 29.45 %) and 45.6 % on a test set.</abstract>

This paper introduces CVTE Character Checking System in the NLP-TEA-4 shared task for CGED 2017, we use Bi-LSTM to generate the probability of every character, then take two kinds of strategies to decide whether a character is correct or not. This system is probably more suitable to deal with the error type of bad word selection, which is one of four types of errors, and the rest are words re-dundancy, words missing and words disorder. Finally the second <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy">strategy</a> achieves better F1 score than the first one at all of detection level, identification level, position level.</abstract>

      <abstract>Sentiment lexicon is very helpful in dimensional sentiment applications. Because of countless <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Chinese_words_of_English_origin">Chinese words</a>, developing a method to predict unseen <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Chinese_words_of_English_origin">Chinese words</a> is required. The proposed method can handle both words and phrases by using an ADVWeight List for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_prediction">word prediction</a>, which in turn improves our performance at phrase level. The evaluation results demonstrate that our <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System">system</a> is effective in dimensional sentiment analysis for Chinese phrases. The Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Pearson’s Correlation Coefficient (PCC) for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valence_(psychology)">Valence</a> are 0.723 and 0.835, respectively, and those for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arousal">Arousal</a> are 0.914 and 0.756, respectively.</abstract>

      <abstract>This paper presents two vector representations proposed by National Chiayi University (NCYU) about phrased-based sentiment detection which was used to compete in dimensional sentiment analysis for Chinese phrases (DSACP) at IJCNLP 2017. The vector-based sentiment phraselike unit analysis models are proposed in this article. E-HowNet-based clustering is used to obtain the values of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valence_(psychology)">valence</a> and arousal for sentiment words first. An out-of-vocabulary function is also defined in this article to measure the dimensional emotion values for unknown words. For predicting the corresponding values of sentiment phrase-like unit, a vectorbased approach is proposed here. According to the experimental results, we can find the proposed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method">approach</a> is efficacious.</abstract>

      <abstract>IJCNLP-17 Review Opinion Diversification (RevOpiD-2017) task has been designed for ranking the top-k reviews of a product from a set of reviews, which assists in identifying a summarized output to express the opinion of the entire review set. The task is divided into three independent subtasks as subtask-A, subtask-B, and subtask-C. Each of these three subtasks selects the top-k reviews based on helpfulness, representativeness, and exhaustiveness of the opinions expressed in the review set individually. In order to develop the modules and predict the rank of reviews for all three subtasks, we have employed two well-known supervised classifiers namely, Nave Bayes and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression">Logistic Regression</a> on the top of several extracted features such as the number of nouns, number of verbs, and number of sentiment words etc from the provided datasets. Finally, the organizers have helped to validate the predicted outputs for all three subtasks by using their evaluation metrics. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_(mathematics)">metrics</a> provide the scores of list size 5 as (0.80 (mth)) for subtask-A, (0.86 (cos), 0.87 (cos d), 0.71 (cpr), 4.98 (a-dcg), and 556.94 (wt)) for subtask B, and (10.94 (unwt) and 0.67 (recall)) for subtask C individually.</abstract>

      <abstract>The analysis of customer feedback is useful to provide good customer service. There are a lot of online customer feedback are produced. Manual classification is impractical because the high volume of data. Therefore, the automatic classification of the customer feedback is of importance for the analysis system to identify meanings or intentions that the customer express. The aim of shared Task 4 of IJCNLP 2017 is to classify the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_service">customer feedback</a> into six tags categorization. In this paper, we present a system that uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_embedding">word embeddings</a> to express the feature of the sentence in the corpus and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_network">neural network</a> as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_classification">classifier</a> to complete the shared task. And then the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ensemble_learning">ensemble method</a> is used to get final predictive result. The proposed method get ranked first among twelve teams in terms of micro-averaged F1 and second for accura-cy metric.</abstract>

      <abstract>In this age of the digital economy, promoting organisations attempt their best to engage the customers in the feedback provisioning process. With the assistance of customer insights, an organisation can develop a better product and provide a better service to its customer. In this paper, we analyse the real world samples of customer feedback from Microsoft Office customers in four languages, i.e., <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language">English</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language">French</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_language">Spanish</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_language">Japanese</a> and conclude a five-plus-one-classes categorisation (comment, request, bug, complaint, meaningless and undetermined) for meaning classification. The task is to % access multilingual corpora annotated by the proposed meaning categorization scheme and develop a system to determine what class(es) the customer feedback sentences should be annotated as in four languages. We propose following approaches to accomplish this task : (i) a multinomial naive bayes (MNB) approach for multi-label classification, (ii) MNB with one-vs-rest classifier approach, and (iii) the combination of the multilabel classification-based and the sentiment classification-based approach. Our best system produces <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-score">F-scores</a> of 0.67, 0.83, 0.72 and 0.7 for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language">English</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_language">Spanish</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language">French</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_language">Japanese</a>, respectively. The results are competitive to the best ones for all languages and secure 3rd and 5th position for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_language">Japanese</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language">French</a>, respectively, among all submitted systems.</abstract>

      <abstract>Analyzing customer feedback is the best way to channelize the data into new <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing_strategy">marketing strategies</a> that benefit entrepreneurs as well as customers. Therefore an automated system which can analyze the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_behaviour">customer behavior</a> is in great demand. Users may write feedbacks in any language, and hence mining appropriate information often becomes intractable. Especially in a traditional feature-based supervised model, it is difficult to build a generic system as one has to understand the concerned language for finding the relevant <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_(machine_learning)">features</a>. In order to overcome this, we propose deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) based approaches that do not require handcrafting of features. We evaluate these techniques for analyzing customer feedback sentences on four languages, namely <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language">English</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language">French</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_language">Japanese</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_language">Spanish</a>. Our empirical analysis shows that our <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model">models</a> perform well in all the four languages on the setups of IJCNLP Shared Task on Customer Feedback Analysis. Our <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model">model</a> achieved the second rank in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language">French</a>, with an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision">accuracy</a> of 71.75 % and third ranks for all the other languages.</abstract>

      <abstract>In this paper, we perform convolutional neural networks (CNN) to learn the joint representations of question-answer pairs first, then use the joint representations as the inputs of the long short-term memory (LSTM) with attention to learn the answer sequence of a question for labeling the matching quality of each answer. We also incorporating external knowledge by training Word2Vec on Flashcards data, thus we get more compact embedding. Experimental results show that our <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methodology">method</a> achieves better or comparable performance compared with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseline_(configuration_management)">baseline system</a>. The proposed approach achieves the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision">accuracy</a> of 0.39, 0.42 in English valid set, test set, respectively.</abstract>

      <abstract>Multi-choice question answering in exams is a typical QA task. To accomplish this task, we present an answer localization method to locate answers shown in web pages, considering structural information and semantic information both. Using this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methodology">method</a> as basis, we analyze sentences and paragraphs appeared on web pages to get predictions. With this answer localization system, we get effective results on both <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_validation">validation dataset</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_data">test dataset</a>.</abstract>

      <abstract>A shared task is a typical question answering task that aims to test how accurately the participants can answer the questions in exams. Typically, for each question, there are four candidate answers, and only one of the answers is correct. The existing methods for such a task usually implement a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrent_neural_network">recurrent neural network (RNN)</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_short-term_memory">long short-term memory (LSTM)</a>. However, both RNN and LSTM are biased models in which the words in the tail of a sentence are more dominant than the words in the header. In this paper, we propose the use of an attention-based LSTM (AT-LSTM) model for these tasks. By adding an attention mechanism to the standard LSTM, this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model">model</a> can more easily capture long contextual information.</abstract>

      <abstract>Neural networks, also with a fancy name <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning">deep learning</a>, just right can overcome the above feature engineering problem.

      <abstract>In the past decade, spoken dialogue systems have been the most prominent component in today’s personal assistants. A lot of devices have incorporated dialogue system modules, which allow users to speak naturally in order to finish tasks more efficiently. The traditional conversational systems have rather complex and/or modular pipelines. The advance of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning">deep learning technologies</a> has recently risen the applications of neural models to dialogue modeling. Nevertheless, applying deep learning technologies for building robust and scalable dialogue systems is still a challenging task and an open research area as it requires deeper understanding of the classic pipelines as well as detailed knowledge on the benchmark of the models of the prior work and the recent state-of-the-art work. Therefore, this tutorial is designed to focus on an overview of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialogue_system">dialogue system</a> development while describing most recent research for building task-oriented and chit-chat dialogue systems, and summarizing the challenges. We target the audience of students and practitioners who have some deep learning background, who want to get more familiar with conversational dialogue systems.</abstract>

      <abstract>Machine Translation (MT) is a sub-field of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuro-linguistic_programming">NLP</a> which has experienced a number of paradigm shifts since its inception. Up until 2014, Phrase Based Statistical Machine Translation (PBSMT) approaches used to be the state of the art. In late 2014, Neural Machine Translation (NMT) was introduced and was proven to outperform all PBSMT approaches by a significant margin. Since then, the NMT approaches have undergone several transformations which have pushed the state of the art even further. This tutorial is primarily aimed at researchers who are either interested in or are fairly new to the world of NMT and want to obtain a deep understanding of NMT fundamentals. Because it will also cover the latest developments in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-verbal_communication">NMT</a>, it should also be useful to attendees with some experience in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-verbal_communication">NMT</a>.</abstract>

      <abstract>There is no question that our research community have, and still has been producing an insurmountable amount of interesting strategies, models and tools to a wide array of problems and challenges in diverse areas of knowledge. But for as long as interesting work has existed, we’ve been plagued by a great unsolved mystery : how come there is so much interesting work being published in conferences, but not as many interesting and engaging posters and presentations being featured in them? In this tutorial, we present practical step-by-step makeup solutions for poster, slides and oral presentations in order to help researchers who feel like they are not able to convey the importance of their research to the community in conferences.</abstract>
