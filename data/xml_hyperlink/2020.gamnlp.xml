      <abstract>A weak point of rule-based sentiment analysis systems is that the underlying sentiment lexicons are often not adapted to the domain of the text we want to analyze. We created a game-specific sentiment lexicon for video game Skyrim based on the E-ANEW word list and a dataset of Skyrim’s in-game documents. We calculated sentiment ratings for NPC dialogue using both our <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexicon">lexicon</a> and E-ANEW and compared the resulting sentiment ratings to those of human raters. Both lexicons perform comparably well on our evaluation dialogues, but the game-specific extension performs slightly better on the dominance dimension for dialogue segments and the arousal dimension for full dialogues. To our knowledge, this is the first time that a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentiment_analysis">sentiment analysis lexicon</a> has been adapted to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game">video game domain</a>.</abstract>

      <abstract>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESP_Game">ESP Game</a> (also known as the Google Image Labeler) demonstrated how the crowd could perform a task that is straightforward for humans but challenging for computers   providing labels for images. The game facilitated the task of basic image labeling ; however, the labels generated were non-specific and limited the ability to distinguish similar images from one another, limiting its ability in search tasks, annotating images for the visually impaired, and training computer vision machine algorithms. In this paper, we describe ClueMeIn, an entertaining web-based game with a purpose that generates more detailed image labels than the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESP_Game">ESP Game</a>. We conduct experiments to generate specific image labels, show how the results can lead to improvements in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision">accuracy</a> of image searches over image labels generated by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESP_Game">ESP Game</a> when using the same public dataset.</abstract>

      <abstract>Errors commonly exist in machine-generated documents and publication materials ; however, some correction algorithms do not perform well for complex errors and it is costly to employ humans to do the task. To solve the problem, a prototype <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PC_game">computer game</a> called Cipher was developed that encourages people to identify errors in text. Gamification is achieved by introducing the idea of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steganography">steganography</a> as the entertaining game element. People play the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game">game</a> for entertainment while they make valuable annotations to locate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typographical_error">text errors</a>. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prototype">prototype</a> was tested by 35 players in a evaluation experiment, creating 4,764 annotations. After filtering the data, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System">system</a> detected manually introduced text errors and also genuine errors in the texts that were not noticed when they were introduced into the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game">game</a>.</abstract>

      <abstract>GWAP design might have a tremendous effect on its popularity of course but also on the quality of the data collected. In this paper, a comparison is undertaken between two GWAPs for building term association lists, namely JeuxDeMots and Quicky Goose. After comparing both game designs, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohen_kappa">Cohen kappa</a> of associative lists in various configurations is computed in order to assess likeness and differences of the data they provide.</abstract>

      <abstract>In this paper, we describe a Telegram bot, Mago della Ghigliottina (Ghigliottina Wizard), able to solve La Ghigliottina game (The Guillotine), the final game of the Italian TV quiz show L’Eredit. Our system relies on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing">linguistic resources</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence">artificial intelligence</a> and achieves better results than human players (and competitors of L’Eredit too). In addition to solving a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game">game</a>, Mago della Ghigliottina can also generate new <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game">game instances</a> and challenge the users to match the solution.</abstract>

      <abstract>Gamification has been applied to many linguistic annotation tasks, as an alternative to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crowdsourcing">crowdsourcing platforms</a> to collect annotated data in an inexpensive way. However, we think that still much has to be explored. Games with a Purpose (GWAPs) tend to lack important elements that we commonly see in commercial games, such as 2D and 3D worlds or a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plot_(narrative)">story</a>. Making GWAPs more similar to full-fledged video games in order to involve users more easily and increase dissemination is a demanding yet interesting ground to explore. In this paper we present a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-playing_video_game">3D role-playing game</a> for abusive language annotation that is currently under development.</abstract>
