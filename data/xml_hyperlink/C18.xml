      <abstract>Recent neural network methods for zero pronoun resolution explore multiple models for generating <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representation_(mathematics)">representation vectors</a> for zero pronouns and their candidate antecedents. Typically, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Context_(language_use)">contextual information</a> is utilized to encode the zero pronouns since they are simply gaps that contain no actual content. To better utilize contexts of the zero pronouns, we here introduce the self-attention mechanism for encoding zero pronouns. With the help of the multiple hops of attention, our model is able to focus on some informative parts of the associated texts and therefore produces an efficient way of encoding the zero pronouns. In addition, an attention-based recurrent neural network is proposed for encoding candidate antecedents by their contents. Experiment results are encouraging : our proposed attention-based model gains the best performance on the Chinese portion of the OntoNotes corpus, substantially surpasses existing Chinese zero pronoun resolution baseline systems.</abstract>

      <abstract>This paper analyzes arguably the most challenging yet under-explored aspect of resolution tasks such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coreference_resolution">coreference resolution</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity–relationship_model">entity linking</a>, that is the resolution of plural mentions. Unlike <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_number">singular mentions</a> each of which represents one entity, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_number">plural mentions</a> stand for multiple entities. To tackle this aspect, we take the character identification corpus from the SemEval 2018 shared task that consists of entity annotation for singular mentions, and expand it by adding <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annotation">annotation</a> for plural mentions. We then introduce a novel coreference resolution algorithm that selectively creates clusters to handle both singular and plural mentions, and also a deep learning-based entity linking model that jointly handles both types of mentions through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-task_learning">multi-task learning</a>. Adjusted evaluation metrics are proposed for these <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Task_(project_management)">tasks</a> as well to handle the uniqueness of plural mentions. Our experiments show that the new coreference resolution and entity linking models significantly outperform traditional <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model">models</a> designed only for singular mentions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plural">plural mentions</a> are thoroughly analyzed for these two resolution tasks.</abstract>

      <abstract>We present a neural transition-based model that uses a simple set of edit actions (copy, delete, insert) for morphological transduction tasks such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflection">inflection generation</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemmatization">lemmatization</a>, and reinflection. In a large-scale evaluation on four datasets and dozens of languages, our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art systems on low and medium training-set sizes and is competitive in the high-resource setting. Learning to apply a generic copy action enables our approach to generalize quickly from a few data points. We successfully leverage minimum risk training to compensate for the weaknesses of MLE parameter learning and neutralize the negative effects of training a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipeline_(software)">pipeline</a> with a separate character aligner.</abstract>

      <abstract>Capturing interactions among multiple predicate-argument structures (PASs) is a crucial issue in the task of analyzing PAS in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_language">Japanese</a>. In this paper, we propose new Japanese PAS analysis models that integrate the label prediction information of arguments in multiple PASs by extending the input and last layers of a standard deep bidirectional recurrent neural network (bi-RNN) model. In these models, using the mechanisms of pooling and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention">attention</a>, we aim to directly capture the potential interactions among multiple PASs, without being disturbed by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_order">word order</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distance">distance</a>. Our experiments show that the proposed models improve the prediction accuracy specifically for cases where the predicate and argument are in an indirect dependency relation and achieve a new state of the art in the overall <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-number">F_1</a> on a standard benchmark corpus.<tex-math>F_1</tex-math> on a standard benchmark corpus.</abstract>

      <abstract>Non-local features have been exploited by syntactic parsers for capturing dependencies between sub output structures. Such <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_(machine_learning)">features</a> have been a key to the success of state-of-the-art <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsing">statistical parsers</a>. With the rise of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning">deep learning</a>, however, it has been shown that local output decisions can give highly competitive accuracies, thanks to the power of dense neural input representations that embody global syntactic information. We investigate two conceptually simple local neural models for constituent parsing, which make local decisions to constituent spans and CFG rules, respectively. Consistent with previous findings along the line, our best <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model">model</a> gives highly competitive results, achieving the labeled bracketing F1 scores of 92.4 % on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_score">PTB</a> and 87.3 % on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_score">CTB</a> 5.1.</abstract>

      <abstract>The paper explores the ability of LSTM networks trained on a language modeling task to detect linguistic structures which are ungrammatical due to extraction violations (extra arguments and subject-relative clause island violations), and considers its implications for the debate on language innatism. The results show that the current RNN model can correctly classify (un)grammatical sentences, in certain conditions, but it is sensitive to linguistic processing factors and probably ultimately unable to induce a more abstract notion of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammaticality">grammaticality</a>, at least in the domain we tested.</abstract>

Since each state legislature is guided by their own procedures, politics and issues, however, it is difficult to qualitatively asses the factors that affect the likelihood of a legislative initiative succeeding. We present several methods for modeling the likelihood of a bill receiving floor action across all 50 states and D.C. We utilize the lexical content of over 1 million bills, along with contextual legislature and legislator derived features to build our predictive models, allowing a comparison of what factors are important to the lawmaking process. Furthermore, we show that these <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal">signals</a> hold complementary predictive power, together achieving an average improvement in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision">accuracy</a> of 18 % over state specific baselines.</abstract>

      <abstract>Event relation recognition is a challenging <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_processing_in_the_brain">language processing task</a>. It is required to determine the relation class of a pair of query events, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality">causality</a>, under the condition that there is n’t any reliable clue for use. We follow the traditional statistical approach in this paper, speculating the relation class of the target events based on the relation-class distributions on the similar events. There is minimal <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supervisor">supervision</a> used during the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speculation">speculation process</a>. In particular, we incorporate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_image_processing">image processing</a> into the acquisition of similar event instances, including the utilization of images for visually representing event scenes, and the use of the neural network based image matching for approximate calculation between events. We test our method on the ACE-R2 corpus and compared our model with the fully-supervised neural network models. Experimental results show that we achieve a comparable performance to CNN while slightly better than LSTM.</abstract>

      <abstract>Sequence-to-sequence model has been applied to solve <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_problem_(mathematics)">math word problems</a>. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model">model</a> takes math problem descriptions as input and generates equations as output. The advantage of sequence-to-sequence model requires no <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_engineering">feature engineering</a> and can generate equations that do not exist in training data. However, our experimental analysis reveals that this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model">model</a> suffers from two shortcomings : (1) generate spurious numbers ; (2) generate numbers at wrong positions. In this paper, we propose incorporating copy and alignment mechanism to the sequence-to-sequence model (namely CASS) to address these shortcomings. To train our <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model">model</a>, we apply <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning">reinforcement learning</a> to directly optimize the solution accuracy. It overcomes the train-test discrepancy issue of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_likelihood_estimation">maximum likelihood estimation</a>, which uses the surrogate objective of maximizing equation likelihood during training while the evaluation metric is solution accuracy (non-differentiable) at test time. Furthermore, to explore the effectiveness of our neural model, we use our <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model">model</a> output as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_(machine_learning)">feature</a> and incorporate it into the feature-based model. Experimental results show that (1) The copy and alignment mechanism is effective to address the two issues ; (2) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning">Reinforcement learning</a> leads to better performance than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_likelihood_estimation">maximum likelihood</a> on this task ; (3) Our neural model is complementary to the feature-based model and their combination significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art results.</abstract>

We argue that this assumption does not hold, and that instead we need to develop simplification systems that adapt to the individual needs of specific users. As a first step towards personalized simplification, we propose a framework for adaptive lexical simplification and introduce Lexi, a free open-source and easily extensible tool for adaptive, personalized text simplification.

      <abstract>Identifying emergent research trends is a key issue for both primary researchers as well as secondary research managers. Such processes can uncover the historical development of an area, and yield insight on developing topics. We propose an embedded trend detection framework for this task which incorporates our bijunctive hypothesis that important phrases are written by important authors within a field and vice versa. By ranking both author and phrase information in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multigraph">multigraph</a>, our method jointly determines key phrases and authoritative authors. We represent this intermediate output as phrasal embeddings, and feed this to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrent_neural_network">recurrent neural network (RNN)</a> to compute trend scores that identify research trends. Over two large datasets of scientific articles, we demonstrate that our approach successfully detects past trends from the field, outperforming baselines based solely on text centrality or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citation">citation</a>.</abstract>

      <abstract>In this paper, we study how we can improve a deep learning approach to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Textual_entailment">textual entailment</a> by incorporating lexical entailment relations from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WordNet">WordNet</a>. Our idea is to embed the lexical entailment knowledge contained in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WordNet">WordNet</a> in specially-learned word vectors, which we call entailment vectors. We present a standard neural network model and a novel set-theoretic model to learn these entailment vectors from word pairs with known lexical entailment relations derived from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WordNet">WordNet</a>. We further incorporate these entailment vectors into a decomposable attention model for textual entailment and evaluate the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model">model</a> on the SICK and the SNLI dataset. We find that using these special entailment word vectors, we can significantly improve the performance of textual entailment compared with a baseline that uses only standard word2vec vectors. The final performance of our model is close to or above the state of the art, but our method does not rely on any manually-crafted rules or extensive syntactic features.</abstract>

      <abstract>Recently, a significant number of studies have focused on neural information retrieval (IR) models. One category of works use unlabeled data to train general word embeddings based on term proximity, which can be integrated into traditional IR models. The other category employs <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_(computing)">labeled data</a> (e.g. click-through data) to train end-to-end neural IR models consisting of layers for target-specific representation learning. The latter idea accounts better for the IR task and is favored by recent research works, which is the one we will follow in this paper. We hypothesize that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_semantics">general semantics</a> learned from unlabeled data can complement task-specific representation learned from labeled data of limited quality, and that a combination of the two is favorable. To this end, we propose a learning framework which can benefit from both labeled and more abundant unlabeled data for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representation_learning">representation learning</a> in the context of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared">IR</a>. Through a joint learning fashion in a single neural framework, the learned representation is optimized to minimize both the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supervised_learning">supervised loss</a> on query-document matching and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unsupervised_learning">unsupervised loss</a> on text reconstruction. Standard <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_retrieval">retrieval</a> experiments on TREC collections indicate that the joint learning methodology leads to significant better performance of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_retrieval">retrieval</a> over several strong baselines for IR.</abstract>

      <abstract>In this paper, we present a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methodology">method</a> which learns the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_embedding">word embedding</a> for readability assessment. For the existing word embedding models, they typically focus on the syntactic or semantic relations of words, while ignoring the reading difficulty, thus they may not be suitable for readability assessment. Hence, we provide the knowledge-enriched word embedding (KEWE), which encodes the knowledge on reading difficulty into the representation of words. Specifically, we extract the knowledge on word-level difficulty from three perspectives to construct a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_graph">knowledge graph</a>, and develop two word embedding models to incorporate the difficulty context derived from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_graph">knowledge graph</a> to define the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loss_function">loss functions</a>. Experiments are designed to apply KEWE for readability assessment on both English and Chinese datasets, and the results demonstrate both effectiveness and potential of KEWE.</abstract>

      <abstract>The exponential increase in the usage of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a> as a key source of scientific knowledge among the researchers is making it absolutely necessary to metamorphose this knowledge repository into an integral and self-contained source of information for direct utilization. Unfortunately, the references which support the content of each Wikipedia entity page, are far from complete. Why are the reference section ill-formed for most Wikipedia pages? Is this section edited as frequently as the other sections of a page? Can there be appropriate surrogates that can automatically enhance the reference section? In this paper, we propose a novel two step approach   WikiRef   that (i) leverages the wikilinks present in a scientific Wikipedia target page and, thereby, (ii) recommends highly relevant references to be included in that target page appropriately and automatically borrowed from the reference section of the wikilinks. In the first step, we build a classifier to ascertain whether a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki">wikilink</a> is a potential source of reference or not. In the following step, we recommend references to the target page from the reference section of the wikilinks that are classified as potential sources of references in the first step. We perform an extensive evaluation of our approach on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_set">datasets</a> from two different domains   Computer Science and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics">Physics</a>. For <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science">Computer Science</a> we achieve a notably good performance with a precision@1 of 0.44 for reference recommendation as opposed to 0.38 obtained from the most competitive baseline. For the Physics dataset, we obtain a similar performance boost of 10 % with respect to the most competitive baseline.</abstract>

      <abstract>Effective textual communication depends on readers being proficient enough to comprehend texts, and texts being clear enough to be understood by the intended audience, in a reading task. When the meaning of textual information and instructions is not well conveyed, many losses and damages may occur. Among the solutions to alleviate this problem is the automatic evaluation of sentence readability, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Task_(project_management)">task</a> which has been receiving a lot of attention due to its large applicability. However, a shortage of resources, such as corpora for training and evaluation, hinders the full development of this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Task_(project_management)">task</a>. In this paper, we generate a nontrivial sentence corpus in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portuguese_language">Portuguese</a>. We evaluate three scenarios for building it, taking advantage of a parallel corpus of simplification, in which each sentence triplet is aligned and has simplification operations annotated, being ideal for justifying possible mistakes of future methods. The best scenario of our <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_corpus">corpus</a> PorSimplesSent is composed of 4,888 pairs, which is bigger than a similar corpus for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language">English</a> ; all the three versions of it are publicly available. We created four baselines for PorSimplesSent and made available a pairwise ranking method, using 17 linguistic and psycholinguistic features, which correctly identifies the ranking of sentence pairs with an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision">accuracy</a> of 74.2 %.</abstract>

      <abstract>This paper proposes to perform natural language inference with Word-Pair-Dependency-Triplets. Most previous DNN-based approaches either ignore syntactic dependency among words, or directly use tree-LSTM to generate sentence representation with irrelevant information. To overcome the problems mentioned above, we adopt Word-Pair-Dependency-Triplets to improve <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence_alignment">alignment</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_inference">inference judgment</a>. To be specific, instead of comparing each <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuplet">triplet</a> from one passage with the merged information of another passage, we first propose to perform comparison directly between the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuplet">triplets</a> of the given passage-pair to make the judgement more interpretable. Experimental results show that the performance of our approach is better than most of the approaches that use tree structures, and is comparable to other state-of-the-art approaches.</abstract>

      <abstract>Relation Classification aims to classify the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_relation">semantic relationship</a> between two marked entities in a given sentence. It plays a vital role in a variety of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing">natural language processing applications</a>. Most existing methods focus on exploiting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monolingualism">mono-lingual data</a>, e.g., in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language">English</a>, due to the lack of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annotation">annotated data</a> in other languages. In this paper, we come up with a feature adaptation approach for cross-lingual relation classification, which employs a generative adversarial network (GAN) to transfer feature representations from one language with rich annotated data to another language with scarce annotated data. Such a feature adaptation approach enables feature imitation via the competition between a relation classification network and a rival discriminator. Experimental results on the ACE 2005 multilingual training corpus, treating <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language">English</a> as the source language and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_language">Chinese</a> the target, demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach, yielding an improvement of 5.7 % over the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_the_art">state-of-the-art</a>.</abstract>

      <abstract>Answering questions from university admission exams (Gaokao in Chinese) is a challenging AI task since it requires effective <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_representation_and_reasoning">representation</a> to capture complicated semantic relations between questions and answers.

      <abstract>Automatic charge prediction aims to predict the final charges according to the fact descriptions in criminal cases and plays a crucial role in legal assistant systems. Existing works on charge prediction perform adequately on those high-frequency charges but are not yet capable of predicting few-shot charges with limited cases. Moreover, these exist many confusing charge pairs, whose fact descriptions are fairly similar to each other. To address these issues, we introduce several discriminative attributes of charges as the internal mapping between fact descriptions and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charge_(physics)">charges</a>. These attributes provide additional information for few-shot charges, as well as effective signals for distinguishing confusing charges. More specifically, we propose an attribute-attentive charge prediction model to infer the attributes and charges simultaneously. Experimental results on real-work datasets demonstrate that our proposed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model">model</a> achieves significant and consistent improvements than other state-of-the-art baselines. Specifically, our <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model">model</a> outperforms other baselines by more than 50 % in the few-shot scenario.

The sketch is obtained by using placeholders for specific entities in the SQL query, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Column_(database)">column names</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Table_(database)">table names</a>, aliases and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(computer_science)">variables</a>, in a process similar to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_parsing">semantic parsing</a>.

Then, a second network designed as a dual-encoder SEQ2SEQ model using both the text query and the previously obtained sketch is employed to generate the final SQL query.

      <abstract>Implicit discourse relation recognition aims to understand and annotate the latent relations between two discourse arguments, such as temporal, comparison, etc. Most previous methods encode two discourse arguments separately, the ones considering pair specific clues ignore the bidirectional interactions between two arguments and the sparsity of pair patterns. In this paper, we propose a novel neural Tensor network framework with Interactive Attention and Sparse Learning (TIASL) for implicit discourse relation recognition. (1) We mine the most correlated word pairs from two discourse arguments to model pair specific clues, and integrate them as interactive attention into argument representations produced by the bidirectional long short-term memory network. Meanwhile, (2) the neural tensor network with sparse constraint is proposed to explore the deeper and the more important pair patterns so as to fully recognize discourse relations. The experimental results on PDTB show that our proposed TIASL framework is effective.</abstract>

      <abstract>Implicit discourse relation recognition is a challenging task as the relation prediction without explicit connectives in discourse parsing needs understanding of text spans and can not be easily derived from surface features from the input sentence pairs.

In this paper, we propose a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_model">model</a> augmented with different grained text representations, including character, subword, word, sentence, and sentence pair levels. The proposed deeper model is evaluated on the benchmark treebank and achieves state-of-the-art <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision">accuracy</a> with greater than 48 % in 11-way and F1 score greater than 50 % in 4-way classifications for the first time according to our best knowledge.</abstract>

      <abstract>Sentences in a well-formed text are connected to each other via various links to form the cohesive structure of the text. Current neural machine translation (NMT) systems translate a text in a conventional sentence-by-sentence fashion, ignoring such cross-sentence links and dependencies. This may lead to generate an incoherent target text for a coherent source text. In order to handle this issue, we propose a cache-based approach to modeling <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coherence_(linguistics)">coherence</a> for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_machine_translation">neural machine translation</a> by capturing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Context_(language_use)">contextual information</a> either from recently translated sentences or the entire document. Particularly, we explore two types of caches : a dynamic cache, which stores words from the best translation hypotheses of preceding sentences, and a topic cache, which maintains a set of target-side topical words that are semantically related to the document to be translated. On this basis, we build a new layer to score target words in these two <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_(computing)">caches</a> with a cache-based neural model. Here the estimated probabilities from the cache-based neural model are combined with NMT probabilities into the final word prediction probabilities via a gating mechanism. Finally, the proposed cache-based neural model is trained jointly with NMT system in an end-to-end manner. Experiments and analysis presented in this paper demonstrate that the proposed cache-based model achieves substantial improvements over several state-of-the-art SMT and NMT baselines.</abstract>

      <abstract>Neural machine translation (NMT) systems are usually trained on a large amount of bilingual sentence pairs and translate one sentence at a time, ignoring inter-sentence information. This may make the translation of a sentence ambiguous or even inconsistent with the translations of neighboring sentences. In order to handle this issue, we propose an inter-sentence gate model that uses the same <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encoder">encoder</a> to encode two adjacent sentences and controls the amount of information flowing from the preceding sentence to the translation of the current sentence with an inter-sentence gate. In this way, our proposed model can capture the connection between sentences and fuse recency from neighboring sentences into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_machine_translation">neural machine translation</a>. On several NIST Chinese-English translation tasks, our experiments demonstrate that the proposed inter-sentence gate model achieves substantial improvements over the baseline.</abstract>

      <abstract>This paper focuses on subword-based Neural Machine Translation (NMT). We hypothesize that in the NMT model, the appropriate subword units for the following three modules (layers) can differ : (1) the encoder embedding layer, (2) the decoder embedding layer, and (3) the decoder output layer. We find the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subword">subword</a> based on Sennrich et al. (2016) has a feature that a large vocabulary is a superset of a small vocabulary and modify the NMT model enables the incorporation of several different subword units in a single embedding layer. We refer these small subword features as hierarchical subword features. To empirically investigate our assumption, we compare the performance of several different subword units and hierarchical subword features for both the encoder and decoder embedding layers. We confirmed that incorporating hierarchical subword features in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encoder">encoder</a> consistently improves BLEU scores on the IWSLT evaluation datasets.</abstract>

We empirically evaluate the transliteration task using the traditional weighted finite state transducer (WFST) approach against two neural approaches : the encoder-decoder recurrent neural network method and the recent, non-sequential Transformer method. In order to improve availability of bilingual named entity transliteration datasets, we release personal name bilingual dictionaries mined from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikidata">Wikidata</a> for English to Russian, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_language">Hebrew</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic">Arabic</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katakana">Japanese Katakana</a>.

      <abstract>State-of-the-art entity linkers achieve high accuracy scores with probabilistic methods. However, these <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Score_(statistics)">scores</a> should be considered in relation to the properties of the datasets they are evaluated on. Until now, there has not been a systematic investigation of the properties of entity linking datasets and their impact on system performance. In this paper we report on a series of hypotheses regarding the long tail phenomena in entity linking datasets, their interaction, and their impact on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System">system</a> performance. Our systematic study of these hypotheses shows that evaluation datasets mainly capture head entities and only incidentally cover data from the tail, thus encouraging systems to overfit to popular / frequent and non-ambiguous cases. We find the most difficult cases of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity_linking">entity linking</a> among the infrequent candidates of ambiguous forms. With our findings, we hope to inspire future designs of both <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity–relationship_model">entity linking systems</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_set">evaluation datasets</a>. To support this goal, we provide a list of recommended actions for better inclusion of tail cases.</abstract>

      <abstract>Entity Linking aims to link entity mentions in texts to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_base">knowledge bases</a>, and neural models have achieved recent success in this task. However, most existing methods rely on local contexts to resolve entities independently, which may usually fail due to the data sparsity of local information. To address this issue, we propose a novel neural model for collective entity linking, named as NCEL. NCEL apply Graph Convolutional Network to integrate both local contextual features and global coherence information for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity–relationship_model">entity linking</a>. To improve the computation efficiency, we approximately perform <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolution">graph convolution</a> on a subgraph of adjacent entity mentions instead of those in the entire text. We further introduce an attention scheme to improve the robustness of NCEL to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noise_(signal_processing)">data noise</a> and train the model on Wikipedia hyperlinks to avoid <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overfitting">overfitting</a> and domain bias. In experiments, we evaluate NCEL on five publicly available datasets to verify the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linker_(computing)">linking</a> performance as well as generalization ability. We also conduct an extensive analysis of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_complexity">time complexity</a>, the impact of key modules, and qualitative results, which demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed method.</abstract>

      <abstract>Fundamental to several knowledge-centric applications is the need to identify <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Named_entity">named entities</a> from their textual mentions. However, entities lack a unique representation and their mentions can differ greatly. These variations arise in complex ways that can not be captured using textual similarity metrics. However, entities have underlying structures, typically shared by entities of the same entity type, that can help reason over their name variations. Discovering, learning and manipulating these structures typically requires high manual effort in the form of large amounts of labeled training data and handwritten transformation programs. In this work, we propose an active-learning based framework that drastically reduces the labeled data required to learn the structures of entities. We show that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_program">programs</a> for mapping entity mentions to their structures can be automatically generated using human-comprehensible labels. Our experiments show that our <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_framework">framework</a> consistently outperforms both <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handwriting">handwritten programs</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supervised_learning">supervised learning models</a>.

      <abstract>Named entity recognition (NER) has attracted a substantial amount of research. Recently, several neural network-based models have been proposed and achieved high performance. However, there is little research on fine-grained NER (FG-NER), in which hundreds of named entity categories must be recognized, especially for non-English languages. It is still an open question whether there is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_model">model</a> that is robust across various settings or the proper <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_model">model</a> varies depending on the language, the number of named entity categories, and the size of training datasets. This paper first presents an empirical comparison of FG-NER models for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language">English</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_language">Japanese</a> and demonstrates that LSTM+CNN+CRF (Ma and Hovy, 2016), one of the state-of-the-art methods for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language">English NER</a>, also works well for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language">English FG-NER</a> but does not work well for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_language">Japanese</a>, a language that has a large number of character types. To tackle this problem, we propose a method to improve the neural network-based Japanese FG-NER performance by removing the CNN layer and utilizing dictionary and category embeddings. Experiment results show that the proposed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methodology">method</a> improves Japanese FG-NER F-score from 66.76 % to 75.18 %.</abstract>

      <abstract>Because of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Commons_license">license restrictions</a>, it often becomes impossible to strictly reproduce most research results on Twitter data already a few months after the creation of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_corpus">corpus</a>.

We partly solve this challenge by annotating a new Twitter-like corpus from an alternative large social medium with licenses that are compatible with reproducible experiments : <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastodon_(software)">Mastodon</a>. We manually annotate both dialogues and sentiments on this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_corpus">corpus</a>, and train a multi-task hierarchical recurrent network on joint sentiment and dialog act recognition. We experimentally demonstrate that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_learning">transfer learning</a> may be efficiently achieved between both tasks, and further analyze some specific correlations between sentiments and dialogues on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media">social media</a>.

      <abstract>Self-normalizing discriminative models approximate the normalized probability of a class without having to compute the partition function. In the context of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_model">language modeling</a>, this property is particularly appealing as it may significantly reduce <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_time_(program_lifecycle_phase)">run-times</a> due to large word vocabularies. In this study, we provide a comprehensive investigation of language modeling self-normalization. First, we theoretically analyze the inherent self-normalization properties of Noise Contrastive Estimation (NCE) language models. Then, we compare them empirically to softmax-based approaches, which are self-normalized using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regularization_(mathematics)">explicit regularization</a>, and suggest a hybrid model with compelling properties. Finally, we uncover a surprising negative correlation between self-normalization and perplexity across the board, as well as some regularity in the observed errors, which may potentially be used for improving self-normalization algorithms in the future.</abstract>

      <abstract>Domain adaptation for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentiment_analysis">sentiment analysis</a> is challenging due to the fact that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supervised_learning">supervised classifiers</a> are very sensitive to changes in domain. The two most prominent approaches to this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_solving">problem</a> are structural correspondence learning and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoencoder">autoencoders</a>. However, they either require long training times or suffer greatly on highly divergent domains. Inspired by recent advances in cross-lingual sentiment analysis, we provide a novel perspective and cast the domain adaptation problem as an embedding projection task. Our model takes as input two mono-domain embedding spaces and learns to project them to a bi-domain space, which is jointly optimized to (1) project across domains and to (2) predict sentiment. We perform <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_adaptation">domain adaptation</a> experiments on 20 source-target domain pairs for sentiment classification and report novel state-of-the-art results on 11 domain pairs, including the Amazon domain adaptation datasets and SemEval 2013 and 2016 datasets. Our analysis shows that our <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model">model</a> performs comparably to state-of-the-art approaches on domains that are similar, while performing significantly better on highly divergent domains.

      <abstract>Argumentation mining (AM) requires the identification of complex discourse structures and has lately been applied with success monolingually. In this work, we show that the existing resources are, however, not adequate for assessing cross-lingual AM, due to their heterogeneity or lack of complexity. We therefore create suitable parallel corpora by (human and machine) translating a popular AM dataset consisting of persuasive student essays into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_language">German</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language">French</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_language">Spanish</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_language">Chinese</a>. We then compare (i) annotation projection and (ii) bilingual word embeddings based direct transfer strategies for cross-lingual AM, finding that the former performs considerably better and almost eliminates the loss from cross-lingual transfer. Moreover, we find that annotation projection works equally well when using either costly human or cheap machine translations.

      <abstract>This paper introduces open-domain event detection, a new event detection paradigm to address issues of prior work on restricted domains and event annotation. The goal is to detect all kinds of events regardless of domains. Given the absence of training data, we propose a distant supervision method that is able to generate high-quality training data. Using a manually annotated event corpus as gold standard, our experiments show that despite no direct supervision, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_model">model</a> outperforms <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supervised_learning">supervised models</a>.

      <abstract>Semantic parsers critically rely on accurate and high-coverage lexicons. However, traditional semantic parsers usually utilize annotated logical forms to learn the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexicon">lexicon</a>, which often suffer from the lexicon coverage problem. In this paper, we propose a graph-based semi-supervised learning framework that makes use of large text corpora and lexical resources. This framework first constructs a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(discrete_mathematics)">graph</a> with a phrase similarity model learned by utilizing many <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_corpus">text corpora</a> and lexical resources. Next, graph propagation algorithm identifies the label distribution of unlabeled phrases from labeled ones. We evaluate our approach on two <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benchmark_(computing)">benchmarks</a> : <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebQuest">Webquestions</a> and Free917. The results show that, in both datasets, our method achieves substantial improvement when comparing to the base system that does not utilize the learned lexicon, and gains competitive results when comparing to state-of-the-art systems.</abstract>

      <abstract>Document-level multi-aspect sentiment classification aims to predict user’s sentiment polarities for different aspects of a product in a review. Existing approaches mainly focus on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_(literary_theory)">text information</a>. However, the authors (i.e. users) and overall ratings of reviews are ignored, both of which are proved to be significant on interpreting the sentiments of different aspects in this paper. Therefore, we propose a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_model">model</a> called Hierarchical User Aspect Rating Network (HUARN) to consider user preference and overall ratings jointly. Specifically, HUARN adopts a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_organization">hierarchical architecture</a> to encode word, sentence, and document level information. Then, user attention and aspect attention are introduced into building sentence and document level representation. The document representation is combined with user and overall rating information to predict aspect ratings of a review. Diverse aspects are treated differently and a multi-task framework is adopted. Empirical results on two real-world datasets show that HUARN achieves state-of-the-art performances.</abstract>

      <abstract>Recent evaluations on bilingual lexicon extraction from specialized comparable corpora have shown contrasted performance while using word embedding models. This can be partially explained by the lack of large specialized comparable corpora to build efficient <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representation_(arts)">representations</a>. Within this context, we try to answer the following questions : First, (i) among the state-of-the-art embedding models, whether trained on specialized corpora or pre-trained on large general data sets, which one is the most appropriate model for bilingual terminology extraction? Second (ii) is it worth it to combine multiple embeddings trained on different data sets? For that purpose, we propose the first systematic evaluation of different word embedding models for bilingual terminology extraction from specialized comparable corpora. We emphasize how the character-based embedding model outperforms other <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_model">models</a> on the quality of the extracted bilingual lexicons. Further more, we propose a new efficient way to combine different embedding models learned from specialized and general-domain data sets. Our approach leads to higher performance than the best individual embedding model.</abstract>

      <abstract>We present an evaluation of PASS, a data-to-text system that generates Dutch soccer reports from match statistics which are automatically tailored towards fans of one club or the other. The evaluation in this paper consists of two studies. An intrinsic human-based evaluation of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System">system</a>’s output is described in the first study. In this study it was found that compared to human-written texts, computer-generated texts were rated slightly lower on style-related text components (fluency and clarity) and slightly higher in terms of the correctness of given information. Furthermore, results from the first study showed that tailoring was accurately recognized in most cases, and that participants struggled with correctly identifying whether a text was written by a human or computer. The second study investigated if <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tailor">tailoring</a> affects perceived text quality, for which no results were garnered. This lack of results might be due to negative preconceptions about computer-generated texts which were found in the first study.</abstract>

      <abstract>Machine-reading comprehension (MRC) has recently attracted attention in the fields of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing">natural language processing</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning">machine learning</a>. One of the problematic presumptions with current MRC technologies is that each question is assumed to be answerable by looking at a given text passage. However, to realize human-like language comprehension ability, a machine should also be able to distinguish not-answerable questions (NAQs) from answerable questions. To develop this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(engineering)">functionality</a>, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_set">dataset</a> incorporating hard-to-detect NAQs is vital ; however, its manual construction would be expensive. This paper proposes a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_set">dataset creation method</a> that alters an existing MRC dataset, the Stanford Question Answering Dataset, and describes the resulting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_set">dataset</a>. The value of this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_set">dataset</a> is likely to increase if each <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Question_mark">NAQ</a> in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_set">dataset</a> is properly classified with the difficulty of identifying it as an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Question_mark">NAQ</a>. This difficulty level would allow researchers to evaluate a machine’s NAQ detection performance more precisely. Therefore, we propose a method for automatically assigning difficulty level labels, which measures the similarity between a question and the target text passage. Our NAQ detection experiments demonstrate that the resulting dataset, having difficulty level annotations, is valid and potentially useful in the development of advanced MRC models.</abstract>

      <abstract>The task of obfuscating writing style using sequence models has previously been investigated under the framework of obfuscation-by-transfer, where the input text is explicitly rewritten in another style. A side effect of this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_framework">framework</a> are the frequent major alterations to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web">semantic content</a> of the input. In this work, we propose obfuscation-by-invariance, and investigate to what extent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_model">models</a> trained to be explicitly style-invariant preserve semantics. We evaluate our architectures in parallel and non-parallel settings, and compare automatic and human evaluations on the obfuscated sentences. Our experiments show that the performance of a style classifier can be reduced to chance level, while the output is evaluated to be of equal quality to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_model">models</a> applying style-transfer. Additionally, human evaluation indicates a trade-off between the level of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obfuscation">obfuscation</a> and the observed quality of the output in terms of meaning preservation and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammaticality">grammaticality</a>.</abstract>

      <abstract>This paper describes a transduction language suitable for natural language treebank transformations and motivates its application to tasks that have been used and described in the literature. The language, which is the basis for a tree transduction tool allows for clean, precise and concise description of what has been very confusingly, ambiguously, and incompletely textually described in the literature also allowing easy non-hard-coded implementation. We also aim at getting feedback from the NLP community to eventually converge to a de facto standard for such transduction language.</abstract>

      <abstract>The task of data-to-text generation aims to generate descriptive texts conditioned on a number of database records, and recent neural models have shown significant progress on this task. The attention based encoder-decoder models with copy mechanism have achieved state-of-the-art results on a few data-to-text datasets. However, such <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model">models</a> still face the problem of putting incorrect data records in the generated texts, especially on some more challenging datasets like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RotoWire">RotoWire</a>. In this paper, we propose a two-stage approach with a delayed copy mechanism to improve the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precision_(computer_science)">precision</a> of data records in the generated texts. Our approach first adopts an encoder-decoder model to generate a template text with data slots to be filled and then leverages a proposed delayed copy mechanism to fill in the slots with proper data records. Our delayed copy mechanism can take into account all the information of the input data records and the full generated template text by using double attention, position-aware attention and a pairwise ranking loss. The two <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model">models</a> in the two stages are trained separately. Evaluation results on the RotoWire dataset verify the efficacy of our proposed approach to generate better templates and copy data records more precisely.</abstract>

      <abstract>In aspect level sentiment classification, there are two common tasks : to identify the sentiment of an aspect (category) or a term. As specific instances of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_aspect">aspects</a>, terms explicitly occur in sentences. It is beneficial for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_model">models</a> to focus on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Context_(language_use)">nearby context words</a>. In contrast, as high level semantic concepts of terms, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_aspect">aspects</a> usually have more generalizable representations. However, conventional methods can not utilize the information of aspects and terms at the same time, because few datasets are annotated with both <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_aspect">aspects</a> and terms. In this paper, we propose a novel <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning">deep memory network</a> with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auxiliary_memory">auxiliary memory</a> to address this problem. In our model, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_memory">main memory</a> is used to capture the important <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Context_(language_use)">context words</a> for sentiment classification. In addition, we build an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auxiliary_memory">auxiliary memory</a> to implicitly convert aspects and terms to each other, and feed both of them to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_data_storage">main memory</a>. With the interaction between two memories, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_(linguistics)">features</a> of aspects and terms can be learnt simultaneously. We compare our <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model">model</a> with the state-of-the-art methods on four datasets from different domains. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model">model</a>.</abstract>

Language models and learning methods are so complex that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_publishing">scientific conference papers</a> no longer contain enough space for the technical depth required for replication or reproduction. Taking Target Dependent Sentiment Analysis as a case study, we show how recent work in the field has not consistently released code, or described settings for learning methods in enough detail, and lacks comparability and generalisability in train, test or validation data. To investigate generalisability and to enable state of the art comparative evaluations, we carry out the first reproduction studies of three groups of complementary methods and perform the first large-scale mass evaluation on six different English datasets. Reflecting on our experiences, we recommend that future replication or reproduction experiments should always consider a variety of datasets alongside documenting and releasing their methods and published code in order to minimise the barriers to both <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repeatability">repeatability</a> and generalisability. We have released our code with a model zoo on GitHub with Jupyter Notebooks to aid understanding and full documentation, and we recommend that others do the same with their papers at submission time through an anonymised GitHub account.</abstract>

      <abstract>Rationale-based models provide a unique way to provide justifiable results for relation classification models by identifying rationales (key words and phrases that a person can use to justify the relation in the sentence) during the process. However, existing generative networks used to extract rationales come with a trade-off between extracting diversified rationales and achieving good <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_classification">classification</a> results. In this paper, we propose a multilevel heuristic approach to regulate rationale extraction to avoid extracting monotonous rationales without compromising <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_classification">classification</a> performance. In our model, rationale selection is regularized by a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi-supervised_learning">semi-supervised process</a> and features from different levels : <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word">word</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntax">syntax</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentence_(linguistics)">sentence</a>, and corpus. We evaluate our approach on the SemEval 2010 dataset that includes 19 relation classes and the quality of extracted rationales with our manually-labeled rationales. Experiments show a significant improvement in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_classification">classification performance</a> and a 20 % gain in rationale interpretability compared to state-of-the-art approaches.</abstract>

      <abstract>Multi-lingual relation extraction aims to find unknown relational facts from text in various languages. Existing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model">models</a> can not well capture the consistency and diversity of relation patterns in different languages. To address these issues, we propose an adversarial multi-lingual neural relation extraction (AMNRE) model, which builds both consistent and individual representations for each sentence to consider the consistency and diversity among languages. Further, we adopt an adversarial training strategy to ensure those consistent sentence representations could effectively extract the language-consistent relation patterns. The experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that our AMNRE model significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art models.

      <abstract>Generating an abstract from a collection of documents is a desirable capability for many real-world applications. However, abstractive approaches to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-document_summarization">multi-document summarization</a> have not been thoroughly investigated. This paper studies the feasibility of using Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR), a semantic representation of natural language grounded in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistics">linguistic theory</a>, as a form of content representation. Our approach condenses source documents to a set of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree">summary graphs</a> following the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree">AMR formalism</a>. The summary graphs are then transformed to a set of summary sentences in a surface realization step. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_framework">framework</a> is fully data-driven and flexible. Each component can be optimized independently using small-scale, in-domain training data. We perform experiments on benchmark summarization datasets and report promising results. We also describe opportunities and challenges for advancing this line of research.</abstract>

      <abstract>In this work, we aim at developing an unsupervised abstractive summarization system in the multi-document setting. We design a paraphrastic sentence fusion model which jointly performs sentence fusion and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paraphrasing">paraphrasing</a> using skip-gram word embedding model at the sentence level. Our <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model">model</a> improves the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coverage_(statistics)">information coverage</a> and at the same time abstractiveness of the generated sentences. We conduct our experiments on the human-generated multi-sentence compression datasets and evaluate our system on several newly proposed Machine Translation (MT) evaluation metrics. Furthermore, we apply our sentence level model to implement an abstractive multi-document summarization system where documents usually contain a related set of sentences. We also propose an optimal solution for the classical summary length limit problem which was not addressed in the past research. For the document level summary, we conduct experiments on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_set">datasets</a> of two different domains (e.g., <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_(publishing)">news article</a> and user reviews) which are well suited for multi-document abstractive summarization.

      <abstract>Domain Adaptation arises when we aim at learning from source domain a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model">model</a> that can perform acceptably well on a different target domain. It is especially crucial for Natural Language Generation (NLG) in Spoken Dialogue Systems when there are sufficient annotated data in the source domain, but there is a limited labeled data in the target domain. How to effectively utilize as much of existing abilities from source domains is a crucial issue in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_adaptation">domain adaptation</a>. In this paper, we propose an adversarial training procedure to train a Variational encoder-decoder based language generator via multiple adaptation steps. In this procedure, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_model">model</a> is first trained on a source domain data and then fine-tuned on a small set of target domain utterances under the guidance of two proposed critics. Experimental results show that the proposed method can effectively leverage the existing knowledge in the source domain to adapt to another related domain by using only a small amount of in-domain data.</abstract>

      <abstract>Our goal is to explore how the abilities brought in by a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialogue_manager">dialogue manager</a> can be included in end-to-end visually grounded conversational agents. We make initial steps towards this general goal by augmenting a task-oriented visual dialogue model with a decision-making component that decides whether to ask a follow-up question to identify a target referent in an image, or to stop the conversation to make a guess. Our analyses show that adding a decision making component produces dialogues that are less repetitive and that include fewer unnecessary questions, thus potentially leading to more efficient and less unnatural interactions.</abstract>

      <abstract>In this paper, we study the problem of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_augmentation">data augmentation</a> for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural-language_understanding">language understanding</a> in task-oriented dialogue system. In contrast to previous work which augments an utterance without considering its relation with other utterances, we propose a sequence-to-sequence generation based data augmentation framework that leverages one utterance’s same semantic alternatives in the training data. A novel diversity rank is incorporated into the utterance representation to make the model produce diverse utterances and these diversely augmented utterances help to improve the language understanding module. Experimental results on the Airline Travel Information System dataset and a newly created semantic frame annotation on Stanford Multi-turn, Multi-domain Dialogue Dataset show that our framework achieves significant improvements of 6.38 and 10.04 F-scores respectively when only a training set of hundreds utterances is represented. Case studies also confirm that our <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methodology">method</a> generates diverse utterances.</abstract>

      <abstract>The utility of additional semantic information for the task of next utterance selection in an automated dialogue system is the focus of study in this paper. In particular, we show that additional information available in the form of dialogue acts when used along with context given in the form of dialogue history improves the performance irrespective of the underlying model being generative or discriminative. In order to show the model agnostic behavior of dialogue acts, we experiment with several well-known models such as sequence-to-sequence encoder-decoder model, hierarchical encoder-decoder model, and Siamese-based models with and without hierarchy ; and show that in all models, incorporating dialogue acts improves the performance by a significant margin. We, furthermore, propose a novel way of encoding dialogue act information, and use it along with hierarchical encoder to build a model that can use the sequential dialogue act information in a natural way. Our proposed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model">model</a> achieves an MRR of about 84.8 % for the task of next utterance selection on a newly introduced Daily Dialogue dataset, and outperform the baseline models. We also provide a detailed analysis of results including key insights that explain the improvement in MRR because of dialog act information.</abstract>

      <abstract>Recently, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has been used for dialogue policy optimization. However, many DRL-based policies are not sample-efficient. Most recent advances focus on improving DRL optimization algorithms to address this issue. Here, we take an alternative route of designing neural network structure that is better suited for DRL-based dialogue management. The proposed structured deep reinforcement learning is based on graph neural networks (GNN), which consists of some sub-networks, each one for a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertex_(graph_theory)">node</a> on a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_graph">directed graph</a>. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(discrete_mathematics)">graph</a> is defined according to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology_(information_science)">domain ontology</a> and each node can be considered as a sub-agent. During <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision-making">decision making</a>, these sub-agents have internal message exchange between neighbors on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(discrete_mathematics)">graph</a>. We also propose an approach to jointly optimize the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(discrete_mathematics)">graph structure</a> as well as the parameters of GNN. Experiments show that structured DRL significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art approaches in almost all of the 18 tasks of the PyDial benchmark.</abstract>

      <abstract>Learning social media content is the basis of many real-world applications, including information retrieval and recommendation systems, among others. In contrast with previous works that focus mainly on single modal or bi-modal learning, we propose to learn social media content by fusing jointly textual, acoustic, and visual information (JTAV). Effective strategies are proposed to extract fine-grained features of each modality, that is, attBiGRU and DCRNN. We also introduce cross-modal fusion and attentive pooling techniques to integrate multi-modal information comprehensively. Extensive experimental evaluation conducted on real-world datasets demonstrate our proposed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model">model</a> outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches by a large margin.</abstract>

      <abstract>Neural encoder-decoder models have been widely applied to conversational response generation, which is a research hot spot in recent years. However, conventional neural encoder-decoder models tend to generate commonplace responses like I do n’t know regardless of what the input is. In this paper, we analyze this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_solving">problem</a> from a new perspective : <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_vector">latent vectors</a>. Based on it, we propose an easy-to-extend learning framework named MEMD (Multi-Encoder to Multi-Decoder), in which an auxiliary encoder and an auxiliary decoder are introduced to provide necessary training guidance without resorting to extra data or complicating network’s inner structure. Experimental results demonstrate that our method effectively improve the quality of generated responses according to automatic metrics and human evaluations, yielding more diverse and smooth replies.</abstract>

      <abstract>In this paper, we apply different NMT models to the problem of historical spelling normalization for five languages : <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language">English</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_language">German</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_language">Hungarian</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icelandic_language">Icelandic</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swedish_language">Swedish</a>. The NMT models are at different levels, have different <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attentional_control">attention mechanisms</a>, and different neural network architectures. Our results show that NMT models are much better than SMT models in terms of character error rate. The vanilla RNNs are competitive to GRUs / LSTMs in historical spelling normalization. Transformer models perform better only when provided with more training data. We also find that subword-level models with a small subword vocabulary are better than character-level models. In addition, we propose a hybrid method which further improves the performance of historical spelling normalization.</abstract>

      <abstract>Recent years have witnessed a surge of publications aimed at tracing temporal changes in lexical semantics using distributional methods, particularly prediction-based word embedding models. However, this vein of research lacks the cohesion, common terminology and shared practices of more established areas of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing">natural language processing</a>. In this paper, we survey the current state of academic research related to diachronic word embeddings and semantic shifts detection. We start with discussing the notion of semantic shifts, and then continue with an overview of the existing methods for tracing such time-related shifts with word embedding models. We propose several axes along which these methods can be compared, and outline the main challenges before this emerging subfield of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing">NLP</a>, as well as prospects and possible applications.</abstract>

      <abstract>Traditional <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topic_model">topic models</a> are insufficient for topic extraction in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media">social media</a>. The existing methods only consider text information or simultaneously model the posts and the static characteristics of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media">social media</a>. They ignore that one discusses diverse topics when dynamically interacting with different people. Moreover, people who talk about the same topic have different effects on the topic. In this paper, we propose an Interaction-Aware Topic Model (IATM) for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microblogging">microblog conversations</a> by integrating network embedding and user attention. A conversation network linking users based on reposting and replying relationship is constructed to mine the dynamic user behaviours. We model dynamic interactions and user attention so as to learn interaction-aware edge embeddings with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_environment">social context</a>. Then they are incorporated into neural variational inference for generating the more consistent topics.

We propose a bidirectional recurrent neural network based approach to extract parallel sentences from collections of multilingual texts.

      <abstract>Lack of data can be an issue when beginning a new study on historical handwritten documents. In order to deal with this, we present the character-based decoder part of a multilingual approach based on transductive transfer learning for a historical handwriting recognition task on Italian Comedy Registers. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code">decoder</a> must build a sequence of characters that corresponds to a word from a vector of letter-ngrams. As learning data, we created a new dataset from untapped resources that covers the same domain and period of our Italian Comedy data, as well as resources from common domains, periods, or languages. We obtain a 97.42 % <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_recognition">Character Recognition Rate</a> and a 86.57 % <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_recognition">Word Recognition Rate</a> on our Italian Comedy data, despite a lexical coverage of 67 % between the Italian Comedy data and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training,_validation,_and_test_sets">training data</a>.

      <abstract>Mental health is a significant and growing public health concern. As language usage can be leveraged to obtain crucial insights into mental health conditions, there is a need for large-scale, labeled, mental health-related datasets of users who have been diagnosed with one or more of such conditions. In this paper, we investigate the creation of high-precision patterns to identify self-reported diagnoses of nine different <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder">mental health conditions</a>, and obtain high-quality labeled data without the need for manual labelling. We introduce the SMHD (Self-reported Mental Health Diagnoses) dataset and make it available. SMHD is a novel large dataset of social media posts from users with one or multiple <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder">mental health conditions</a> along with matched control users. We examine distinctions in users’ language, as measured by linguistic and psychological variables. We further explore text classification methods to identify individuals with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder">mental conditions</a> through their language.</abstract>

However, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copula_(linguistics)">they</a> are not available in many languages because the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copula_(linguistics)">construction of KBs</a> is expensive.

Beside the accurateness, our main concerns are also the robustness of Quality Estimation models.

Specifically, we show that Quality Estimation models often behave differently in Quality Estimation feature space, depending on whether the scale of feature space is small, medium or large. We also show that Quality Estimation models often behave differently in evaluation settings, depending on whether test data come from the same domain as the training data or not. Our work suggests several strong candidates to use in different circumstances.</abstract>

      <abstract>Proto-word reconstruction is central to the study of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_linguistics">language evolution</a>. It consists of recreating the words in an ancient language from its modern daughter languages. In this paper we investigate automatic word form reconstruction for Latin proto-words. Having modern word forms in multiple Romance languages (French, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese and Romanian), we infer the form of their common Latin ancestors.

      <abstract>In supervised learning of morphological patterns, the strategy of generalizing inflectional tables into more abstract paradigms through alignment of the longest common subsequence found in an inflection table has been proposed as an efficient method to deduce the inflectional behavior of unseen word forms. In this paper, we extend this notion of morphological ‘paradigm’ from earlier work and provide a formalization that more accurately matches linguist intuitions about what an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflectional_paradigm">inflectional paradigm</a> is. Additionally, we propose and evaluate a mechanism for learning full human-readable paradigm specifications from incomplete dataa scenario when we only have access to a few inflected forms for each <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexeme">lexeme</a>, and want to reconstruct the missing inflections as well as generalize and group the witnessed patterns into a model of more abstract paradigmatic behavior of lexemes.</abstract>

      <abstract>Given a set of instances of some relation, the relation induction task is to predict which other word pairs are likely to be related in the same way. While it is natural to use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_embedding">word embeddings</a> for this task, standard approaches based on vector translations turn out to perform poorly. To address this issue, we propose two probabilistic relation induction models. The first <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model">model</a> is based on translations, but uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_things_named_after_Carl_Friedrich_Gauss">Gaussians</a> to explicitly model the variability of these translations and to encode soft constraints on the source and target words that may be chosen. In the second model, we use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_linear_regression">Bayesian linear regression</a> to encode the assumption that there is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_relationship">linear relationship</a> between the vector representations of related words, which is considerably weaker than the assumption underlying translation based models.</abstract>

      <abstract>Recent advances in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language">language modeling</a> using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrent_neural_network">recurrent neural networks</a> have made it viable to model <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language">language</a> as distributions over characters. By learning to predict the next character on the basis of previous characters, such models have been shown to automatically internalize linguistic concepts such as words, sentences, subclauses and even <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentimentality">sentiment</a>. In this paper, we propose to leverage the internal states of a trained character language model to produce a novel type of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_embedding">word embedding</a> which we refer to as contextual string embeddings. Our proposed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embedding">embeddings</a> have the distinct properties that they (a) are trained without any explicit notion of words and thus fundamentally model words as sequences of characters, and (b) are contextualized by their surrounding text, meaning that the same word will have different <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embedding">embeddings</a> depending on its contextual use. We conduct a comparative evaluation against previous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embedding">embeddings</a> and find that our <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embedding">embeddings</a> are highly useful for downstream tasks : across four classic sequence labeling tasks we consistently outperform the previous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_the_art">state-of-the-art</a>. In particular, we significantly outperform previous work on English and German named entity recognition (NER), allowing us to report new state-of-the-art F1-scores on the CoNLL03 shared task. We release all code and pre-trained language models in a simple-to-use framework to the research community, to enable reproduction of these experiments and application of our proposed embeddings to other tasks : https://github.com/zalandoresearch/flair</abstract>

      <abstract>The variational encoder-decoder (VED) encodes source information as a set of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_variable">random variables</a> using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_network">neural network</a>, which in turn is decoded into target data using another <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_network">neural network</a>. In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing">natural language processing</a>, sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) models typically serve as encoder-decoder networks. When combined with a traditional (deterministic) attention mechanism, the variational latent space may be bypassed by the attention model, and thus becomes ineffective. In this paper, we propose a variational attention mechanism for VED, where the attention vector is also modeled as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution">Gaussian distributed random variables</a>. Results on two experiments show that, without loss of quality, our proposed method alleviates the bypassing phenomenon as it increases the diversity of generated sentences.</abstract>

      <abstract>Seq2seq learning has produced promising results on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_summarization">summarization</a>. However, in many cases, system summaries still struggle to keep the meaning of the original intact. They may miss out important words or relations that play critical roles in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntax">syntactic structure</a> of source sentences. In this paper, we present structure-infused copy mechanisms to facilitate copying important words and relations from the source sentence to summary sentence. The approach naturally combines source dependency structure with the copy mechanism of an abstractive sentence summarizer. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of incorporating source-side syntactic information in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System">system</a>, and our proposed approach compares favorably to state-of-the-art methods.</abstract>

      <abstract>Automatic image description systems typically produce generic sentences that only make use of a small subset of the vocabulary available to them. In this paper, we consider the production of generic descriptions as a lack of diversity in the output, which we quantify using established <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_(mathematics)">metrics</a> and two new <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_(mathematics)">metrics</a> that frame image description as a word recall task. This framing allows us to evaluate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System">system</a> performance on the head of the vocabulary, as well as on the long tail, where <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System">system</a> performance degrades. We use these <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_(mathematics)">metrics</a> to examine the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diversity_index">diversity</a> of the sentences generated by nine state-of-the-art systems on the MS COCO data set. We find that the systems trained with maximum likelihood objectives produce less diverse output than those trained with additional adversarial objectives. However, the adversarially-trained models only produce more types from the head of the vocabulary and not the tail. Besides vocabulary-based methods, we also look at the compositional capacity of the systems, specifically their ability to create <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compound_(linguistics)">compound nouns</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preposition_and_postposition">prepositional phrases</a> of different lengths. We conclude that there is still much room for improvement, and offer a toolkit to measure progress towards the goal of generating more diverse image descriptions.</abstract>

      <abstract>Enabling a mechanism to understand a temporal story and predict its ending is an interesting issue that has attracted considerable attention, as in case of the ROC Story Cloze Task (SCT). In this paper, we develop a multi-attention-based neural network (MANN) with well-designed optimizations, like Highway Network, and concatenated features with embedding representations into the hierarchical neural network model. Considering the particulars of the specific <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Task_(project_management)">task</a>, we thoughtfully extend MANN with external knowledge resources, exceeding state-of-the-art results obviously. Furthermore, we develop a thorough understanding of our <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model">model</a> through a careful hand analysis on a subset of the stories. We identify what traits of MANN contribute to its outperformance and how external knowledge is obtained in such an ending prediction task.</abstract>

      <abstract>Visual Question Generation (VQG) aims to ask natural questions about an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image">image</a> automatically. Existing research focus on training model to fit the annotated data set that makes it indifferent from other language generation tasks. We argue that natural questions need to have two specific attributes from the perspectives of content and linguistic respectively, namely, natural and human-written. Inspired by the setting of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discriminator">discriminator</a> in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adversarial_learning">adversarial learning</a>, we propose two discriminators, one for each attribute, to enhance the training. We then use the reinforcement learning framework to incorporate scores from the two discriminators as the reward to guide the training of the question generator. Experimental results on a benchmark VQG dataset show the effectiveness and robustness of our model compared to some state-of-the-art models in terms of both automatic and human evaluation metrics.</abstract>

      <abstract>Pooling is an essential component of a wide variety of sentence representation and embedding models. This paper explores generalized pooling methods to enhance <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentence_embedding">sentence embedding</a>. We propose vector-based multi-head attention that includes the widely used <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_pooling">max pooling</a>, mean pooling, and scalar self-attention as special cases. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model">model</a> benefits from properly designed penalization terms to reduce redundancy in multi-head attention. We evaluate the proposed model on three different tasks : natural language inference (NLI), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Author_profiling">author profiling</a>, and sentiment classification. The experiments show that the proposed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model">model</a> achieves significant improvement over strong sentence-encoding-based methods, resulting in state-of-the-art performances on four datasets. The proposed approach can be easily implemented for more <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_solving">problems</a> than we discuss in this paper.</abstract>

      <abstract>The literature in automated sarcasm detection has mainly focused on lexical-, syntactic- and semantic-level analysis of text. However, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarcasm">sarcastic sentence</a> can be expressed with contextual presumptions, background and commonsense knowledge. In this paper, we propose a ContextuAl SarCasm DEtector (CASCADE), which adopts a hybrid approach of both content- and context-driven modeling for sarcasm detection in online social media discussions. For the latter, CASCADE aims at extracting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Context_(language_use)">contextual information</a> from the discourse of a discussion thread. Also, since the sarcastic nature and form of expression can vary from person to person, CASCADE utilizes user embeddings that encode stylometric and personality features of users. When used along with content-based feature extractors such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network">convolutional neural networks</a>, we see a significant boost in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_classification">classification</a> performance on a large Reddit corpus.</abstract>

      <abstract>This paper attempts to marry the interpretability of statistical machine learning approaches with the more robust models of joke structure and joke semantics capable of being learned by neural models. Specifically, we explore the use of semantic relatedness features based on word associations, rather than the more common Word2Vec similarity, on a binary humour identification task and identify several factors that make word associations a better fit for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humour">humour</a>. We also explore the effects of using joke structure, in the form of humour anchors (Yang et al., 2015), for improving the performance of semantic features and show that, while an intriguing idea, humour anchors contain several pitfalls that can hurt performance.</abstract>

      <abstract>Spam detection has long been a research topic in both academic and industry due to its wide applications. Previous studies are mainly focused on extracting linguistic or behavior features to distinguish the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spamming">spam and legitimate reviews</a>. Such <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_feature">features</a> are either ineffective or take long time to collect and thus are hard to be applied to cold-start spam review detection tasks. Recent advance leveraged the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_network">neural network</a> to encode the textual and behavior features for the cold-start problem. However, the abundant attribute information are largely neglected by the existing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_framework">framework</a>. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning architecture for incorporating entities and their inherent attributes from various domains into a unified framework. Specifically, our model not only encodes the entities of reviewer, item, and review, but also their attributes such as location, date, price ranges. Furthermore, we present a domain classifier to adapt the knowledge from one domain to the other. With the abundant attributes in existing entities and knowledge in other domains, we successfully solve the problem of data scarcity in the cold-start settings. Experimental results on two Yelp datasets prove that our proposed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_framework">framework</a> significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.</abstract>

      <abstract>Most question answering (QA) systems are based on raw text and structured knowledge graph. However, raw text corpora are hard for QA system to understand, and structured knowledge graph needs intensive manual work, while it is relatively easy to obtain semi-structured tables from many sources directly, or build them automatically. In this paper, we build an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-to-end_principle">end-to-end system</a> to answer multiple choice questions with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi-structured_model">semi-structured tables</a> as its knowledge.

      <abstract>The lack of large-scale question matching corpora greatly limits the development of matching methods in question answering (QA) system, especially for non-English languages. To ameliorate this situation, in this paper, we introduce a large-scale Chinese question matching corpus (named LCQMC), which is released to the public1. LCQMC is more general than paraphrase corpus as it focuses on intent matching rather than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paraphrase">paraphrase</a>. How to collect a large number of question pairs in variant linguistic forms, which may present the same intent, is the key point for such corpus construction. In this paper, we first use a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_search_engine">search engine</a> to collect large-scale question pairs related to high-frequency words from various domains, then filter irrelevant pairs by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wasserstein_distance">Wasserstein distance</a>, and finally recruit three annotators to manually check the left pairs. After this process, a question matching corpus that contains 260,068 question pairs is constructed. In order to verify the LCQMC corpus, we split it into three parts, i.e., a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training,_validation,_and_test_sets">training set</a> containing 238,766 question pairs, a development set with 8,802 question pairs, and a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training,_validation,_and_test_sets">test set</a> with 12,500 question pairs, and test several well-known sentence matching methods on it. The experimental results not only demonstrate the good quality of LCQMC but also provide solid baseline performance for further researches on this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_corpus">corpus</a>.</abstract>

      <abstract>In this reproduction paper, we replicate and extend several past studies on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_learning">transfer learning</a> for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity–relationship_model">entity recognition</a>. In particular, we are interested in entity recognition problems where the class labels in the source and target domains are different. Our work is the first direct comparison of these previously published approaches in this problem setting. In addition, we perform experiments on seven new source / target corpus pairs, nearly doubling the total number of corpus pairs that have been studied in all past work combined. Our results empirically demonstrate when each of the published <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method">approaches</a> tends to do well. In particular, simpler approaches often work best when there is very little labeled target data, while neural transfer approaches tend to do better when there is more labeled target data.</abstract>

      <abstract>Extracting location names from informal and unstructured social media data requires the identification of referent boundaries and partitioning compound names. Variability, particularly systematic variability in location names (Carroll, 1983), challenges the identification task. Some of this variability can be anticipated as operations within a statistical language model, in this case drawn from gazetteers such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenStreetMap">OpenStreetMap (OSM)</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geonames">Geonames</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DBpedia">DBpedia</a>. This permits evaluation of an observed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-gram">n-gram</a> in Twitter targeted text as a legitimate location name variant from the same <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Context_(language_use)">location-context</a>. Using n-gram statistics and location-related dictionaries, our Location Name Extraction tool (LNEx) handles abbreviations and automatically filters and augments the location names in gazetteers (handling name contractions and auxiliary contents) to help detect the boundaries of multi-word location names and thereby delimit them in texts. We evaluated our approach on 4,500 event-specific tweets from three targeted streams to compare the performance of LNEx against that of ten state-of-the-art taggers that rely on standard semantic, syntactic and/or orthographic features. LNEx improved the average F-Score by 33-179 %, outperforming all <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tag_team">taggers</a>. Further, LNEx is capable of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stream_processing">stream processing</a>.</abstract>

We identify that the primary bottleneck in this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_solving">problem</a> is the difficulty in accurately predicting the relations connecting the subject entity to the object entities. We advocate a new model architecture, APVA, which includes a verification mechanism responsible for checking the correctness of predicted relations. The APVA framework naturally supports a well-principled iterative training procedure, which we call turbo training. We demonstrate via experiments that the APVA-TUBRO approach drastically improves the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Question_answering">question answering</a> performance.</abstract>

      <abstract>Multi-relation Question Answering is a challenging task, due to the requirement of elaborated analysis on questions and reasoning over multiple fact triples in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_base">knowledge base</a>. In this paper, we present a novel model called Interpretable Reasoning Network that employs an interpretable, hop-by-hop reasoning process for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Question_answering">question answering</a>. The model dynamically decides which part of an input question should be analyzed at each hop ; predicts a relation that corresponds to the current parsed results ; utilizes the predicted relation to update the question representation and the state of the reasoning process ; and then drives the next-hop reasoning. Experiments show that our <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model">model</a> yields state-of-the-art results on two datasets. More interestingly, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model">model</a> can offer traceable and observable intermediate predictions for reasoning analysis and failure diagnosis, thereby allowing manual manipulation in predicting the final answer.</abstract>

      <abstract>Representation learning is a key issue for most Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. Most existing representation models either learn little structure information or just rely on pre-defined structures, leading to degradation of performance and generalization capability. This paper focuses on learning both local semantic and global structure representations for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_classification">text classification</a>. In detail, we propose a novel Sandwich Neural Network (SNN) to learn semantic and structure representations automatically without relying on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsing">parsers</a>. More importantly, semantic and structure information contribute unequally to the text representation at corpus and instance level. To solve the fusion problem, we propose two strategies : Adaptive Learning Sandwich Neural Network (AL-SNN) and Self-Attention Sandwich Neural Network (SA-SNN). The former learns the weights at corpus level, and the latter further combines <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attentional_control">attention mechanism</a> to assign the weights at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instance_(computer_science)">instance level</a>. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves competitive performance on several text classification tasks, including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentiment_analysis">sentiment analysis</a>, question type classification and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subjectivity">subjectivity classification</a>. Specifically, the accuracies are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiocontrast_agent">MR</a> (82.1 %), SST-5 (50.4 %), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermoelectric_effect">TREC</a> (96 %) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiocontrast_agent">SUBJ</a> (93.9 %).</abstract>

      <abstract>Question answering over <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_graph">knowledge graphs</a> is an important problem of interest both commercially and academically. There is substantial interest in the class of natural language questions that can be answered via the lookup of a single fact, driven by the availability of the popular SimpleQuestions dataset. The problem with this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_set">dataset</a>, however, is that answer triples are provided from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freebase">Freebase</a>, which has been defunct for several years. As a result, it is difficult to build real-world question answering systems that are operationally deployable. Furthermore, a defunct knowledge graph means that much of the infrastructure for querying, browsing, and manipulating triples no longer exists. To address this problem, we present SimpleDBpediaQA, a new benchmark dataset for simple question answering over knowledge graphs that was created by mapping SimpleQuestions entities and predicates from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freebase">Freebase</a> to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DBpedia">DBpedia</a>. Although this mapping is conceptually straightforward, there are a number of nuances that make the task non-trivial, owing to the different conceptual organizations of the two <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_graph">knowledge graphs</a>. To lay the foundation for future research using this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_set">dataset</a>, we leverage recent work to provide simple yet strong baselines with and without <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_network">neural networks</a>.</abstract>

      <abstract>Text classification is one of the most widely studied tasks in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing">natural language processing</a>. Motivated by the principle of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compositionality">compositionality</a>, large multilayer neural network models have been employed for this task in an attempt to effectively utilize the constituent expressions. Almost all of the reported work train large networks using discriminative approaches, which come with a caveat of no proper capacity control, as they tend to latch on to any signal that may not generalize. Using various recent state-of-the-art approaches for text classification, we explore whether these models actually learn to compose the meaning of the sentences or still just focus on some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index_term">keywords</a> or lexicons for classifying the document. To test our hypothesis, we carefully construct <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_set">datasets</a> where the training and test splits have no direct overlap of such lexicons, but overall language structure would be similar. We study various <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_classification">text classifiers</a> and observe that there is a big performance drop on these <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_set">datasets</a>. Finally, we show that even simple models with our proposed regularization techniques, which disincentivize focusing on key lexicons, can substantially improve classification accuracy.</abstract>

      <abstract>A bottleneck problem with Chinese named entity recognition (NER) in new domains is the lack of annotated data. One solution is to utilize the method of distant supervision, which has been widely used in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relation_extraction">relation extraction</a>, to automatically populate annotated training data without humancost. The distant supervision assumption here is that if a string in text is included in a predefined dictionary of entities, the string might be an entity. However, this kind of auto-generated data suffers from two main problems : incomplete and noisy annotations, which affect the performance of NER models. In this paper, we propose a novel approach which can partially solve the above problems of distant supervision for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-equilibrium_thermodynamics">NER</a>. In our approach, to handle the incomplete problem, we apply partial annotation learning to reduce the effect of unknown labels of characters. As for noisy annotation, we design an instance selector based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning">reinforcement learning</a> to distinguish positive sentences from auto-generated annotations. In experiments, we create two <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_set">datasets</a> for Chinese named entity recognition in two domains with the help of distant supervision. The experimental results show that the proposed approach obtains better performance than the comparison systems on both two datasets.</abstract>

Given an input document, we start from a complete solution constructed by a local model and conduct a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_algorithm">search</a> in the space of possible corrections to improve the local solution from a global view point. Our search utilizes a heuristic function to focus more on the least confident local decisions and a pruning function to score the global solutions based on their local fitness and the global coherences among the predicted entities. Experimental results on CoNLL 2003 and TAC 2010 benchmarks verify the effectiveness of our model.</abstract>

We train an initial <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_model">model</a> on source data and transfer it to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_model">model</a> that can recognize new NE categories in the target data during a subsequent step, when the source data is no longer available. Our solution consists in : (i) to reshape and re-parametrize the output layer of the first learned model to enable the recognition of new NEs ; (ii) to leave the rest of the architecture unchanged, such that it is initialized with parameters transferred from the initial model ; and (iii) to fine tune the network on the target data. Most importantly, we design a new NER approach based on sequence to sequence (Seq2Seq) models, which can intuitively work better in our progressive setting. We compare our approach with a Bidirectional LSTM, which is a strong neural NER model. Our experiments show that the Seq2Seq model performs very well on the standard NER setting and it is more robust in the progressive setting. Our approach can recognize previously unseen NE categories while preserving the knowledge of the seen data.</abstract>

      <abstract>We developed three <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System">systems</a> for generating pros and cons summaries of product reviews. Automating this task eases the writing of product reviews, and offers readers quick access to the most important information. We compared SynPat, a system based on syntactic phrases selected on the basis of valence scores, against a neural-network-based system trained to map bag-of-words representations of reviews directly to pros and cons, and the same neural system trained on clusters of word-embedding encodings of similar pros and cons. We evaluated the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System">systems</a> in two ways : first on held-out reviews with gold-standard pros and cons, and second by asking human annotators to rate the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System">systems</a>’ output on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relevance">relevance</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Completeness_(logic)">completeness</a>. In the second evaluation, the gold-standard pros and cons were assessed along with the system output. We find that the human-generated summaries are not deemed as significantly more relevant or complete than the SynPat systems ; the latter are scored higher than the human-generated summaries on a precision metric. The neural approaches yield a lower performance in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_factors_and_ergonomics">human assessment</a>, and are outperformed by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseline_(configuration_management)">baseline</a>.</abstract>

      <abstract>This paper empirically studies the effects of representation choices on neural sentiment analysis for Modern Hebrew, a morphologically rich language (MRL) for which no <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentiment_analysis">sentiment analyzer</a> currently exists. We study two dimensions of representational choices : (i) the granularity of the input signal (token-based vs. morpheme-based), and (ii) the level of encoding of vocabulary items (string-based vs. character-based). We hypothesise that for MRLs, languages where multiple meaning-bearing elements may be carried by a single space-delimited token, these choices will have measurable effects on task perfromance, and that these effects may vary for different architectural designs   fully-connected, convolutional or recurrent. Specifically, we hypothesize that morpheme-based representations will have advantages in terms of their generalization capacity and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision">task accuracy</a>, due to their better <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping">OOV coverage</a>. To empirically study these effects, we develop a new sentiment analysis benchmark for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_language">Hebrew</a>, based on 12 K social media comments, and provide two instances of these data : in token-based and morpheme-based settings. Our experiments show that representation choices empirical effects vary with architecture type. While fully-connected and convolutional networks slightly prefer token-based settings, RNNs benefit from a morpheme-based representation, in accord with the hypothesis that explicit morphological information may help generalize. Our endeavour also delivers the first state-of-the-art broad-coverage sentiment analyzer for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_language">Hebrew</a>, with over 89 % accuracy, alongside an established benchmark to further study the effects of linguistic representation choices on neural networks’ task performance.</abstract>

In the original <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis">regression</a> experiment, different positive interpretations per negation are scored according to their likelihood.

      <abstract>The state-of-the-art methods for relation classification are primarily based on deep neural net- works. This kind of supervised learning method suffers from not only limited training data, but also the large number of low-frequency relations in specific domains. In this paper, we propose the task of exploratory relation classification for domain knowledge harvesting. The goal is to learn a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classifier_(linguistics)">classifier</a> on pre-defined relations and discover new relations expressed in texts. A dynamically structured neural network is introduced to classify entity pairs to a continuously expanded relation set. We further propose the similarity sensitive Chinese restaurant process to discover new relations. Experiments conducted on a large corpus show the effectiveness of our <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_network">neural network</a>, while new relations are discovered with high <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision">precision</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recall_(memory)">recall</a>.</abstract>

      <abstract>Finding names of people killed by police has become increasingly important as police shootings get more and more public attention (police killing detection). Unfortunately, there has been not much work in the literature addressing this problem. The early work in this field (Keith etal., 2017) proposed a distant supervision framework based on Expectation Maximization (EM) to deal with the multiple appearances of the names in documents. However, such EM-based framework can not take full advantages of deep learning models, necessitating the use of handdesigned features to improve the detection performance. In this work, we present a novel deep learning method to solve the problem of police killing recognition. The proposed method relies on hierarchical LSTMs to model the multiple sentences that contain the person names of interests, and introduce supervised attention mechanisms based on semantical word lists and dependency trees to upweight the important contextual words. Our experiments demonstrate the benefits of the proposed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model">model</a> and yield the state-of-the-art performance for police killing detection.</abstract>

      <abstract>We develop CALM, a coordination analyzer that improves upon the conjuncts identified from dependency parses. It uses a language model based scoring and several linguistic constraints to search over hierarchical conjunct boundaries (for nested coordination). By splitting a conjunctive sentence around these conjuncts, CALM outputs several simple sentences. We demonstrate the value of our coordination analyzer in the end task of Open Information Extraction (Open IE). State-of-the-art Open IE systems lose substantial yield due to ineffective processing of conjunctive sentences. Our Open IE system, CALMIE, performs extraction over the simple sentences identified by CALM to obtain up to 1.8x yield with a moderate increase in precision compared to extractions from original sentences.</abstract>

      <abstract>Several semi-supervised representation learning methods have been proposed recently that mitigate the drawbacks of traditional <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrapping_(statistics)">bootstrapping</a> : they reduce the amount of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_drift">semantic drift</a> introduced by iterative approaches through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-shot_learning">one-shot learning</a> ; others address the sparsity of data through the learning of custom, dense representation for the information modeled. In this work, we are the first to adapt three of these methods, most of which have been originally proposed for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_image_processing">image processing</a>, to an information extraction task, specifically, named entity classification. Further, we perform a rigorous comparative analysis on two distinct datasets. Our analysis yields several important observations. First, all <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representation_learning">representation learning methods</a> outperform state-of-the-art <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi-supervised_learning">semi-supervised methods</a> that do not rely on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representation_learning">representation learning</a>. To the best of our knowledge, we report the latest state-of-the-art results on the semi-supervised named entity classification task. Second, one-shot learning methods clearly outperform iterative representation learning approaches. Lastly, one of the best performers relies on the mean teacher framework (Tarvainen and Valpola, 2017), a simple teacher / student approach that is independent of the underlying task-specific model.</abstract>

We categorize the information flow in multimodal processing with respect to cognitive models of human information processing and analyze different methods for combining multimodal representations. Based on this methodological inventory, we discuss the benefit of multimodal grounding for a variety of language processing tasks and the challenges that arise. We particularly focus on multimodal grounding of verbs which play a crucial role for the compositional power of language.</abstract>

      <abstract>Capturing semantic relations between sentences, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_consequence">entailment</a>, is a long-standing challenge for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_semantics">computational semantics</a>. Logic-based models analyse <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_consequence">entailment</a> in terms of possible worlds (interpretations, or situations) where a premise P entails a hypothesis H iff in all worlds where P is true, H is also true. Statistical models view this relationship probabilistically, addressing it in terms of whether a human would likely infer H from P. In this paper, we wish to bridge these two perspectives, by arguing for a visually-grounded version of the Textual Entailment task. Specifically, we ask whether <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model">models</a> can perform better if, in addition to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P_(complexity)">P</a> and H, there is also an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image">image</a> (corresponding to the relevant world or situation). We use a multimodal version of the SNLI dataset (Bowman et al., 2015) and we compare blind and visually-augmented models of textual entailment. We show that visual information is beneficial, but we also conduct an in-depth error analysis that reveals that current multimodal models are not performing grounding in an optimal fashion.</abstract>

      <abstract>This paper explores the influence of spelling errors on lexical variation measures. Lexical richness measures such as Type-Token Ration (TTR) and Yule’s K are often used for learner English analysis and assessment. When applied to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_as_a_second_or_foreign_language">learner English</a>, however, they can be unreliable because of the spelling errors appearing in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_technology">it</a>. Namely, they are, directly or indirectly, based on the counts of distinct word types, and spelling errors undesirably increase the number of distinct words. This paper introduces and examines the hypothesis that lexical richness measures become unstable in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language">learner English</a> because of spelling errors. Specifically, it tests the hypothesis on English learner corpora of three groups (middle school, high school, and college students). To be precise, it estimates the difference in TTR and Yule’s K caused by spelling errors, by calculating their values before and after spelling errors are manually corrected. Furthermore, it examines the results theoretically and empirically to deepen the understanding of the influence of spelling errors on them.</abstract>

      <abstract>Stance detection aims to assign a stance label (for or against) to a post toward a specific target. Recently, there is a growing interest in using neural models to detect <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stance_(linguistics)">stance of documents</a>. Most of these works model the sequence of words to learn document representation. However, much linguistic information, such as polarity and arguments of the document, is correlated with the stance of the document, and can inspire us to explore the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stance_(linguistics)">stance</a>. Hence, we present a neural model to fully employ various <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_description">linguistic information</a> to construct the document representation. In addition, since the influences of different <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_description">linguistic information</a> are different, we propose a hierarchical attention network to weigh the importance of various <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_description">linguistic information</a>, and learn the mutual attention between the document and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_description">linguistic information</a>. The experimental results on two datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed hierarchical attention neural model.</abstract>

      <abstract>Knowledge graphs are a versatile framework to encode richly structured data relationships, but it can be challenging to combine these <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(discrete_mathematics)">graphs</a> with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unstructured_data">unstructured data</a>. Methods for retrofitting pre-trained entity representations to the structure of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_graph">knowledge graph</a> typically assume that entities are embedded in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connectivity_(graph_theory)">connected space</a> and that relations imply similarity. However, useful <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_graph">knowledge graphs</a> often contain diverse entities and relations (with potentially disjoint underlying corpora) which do not accord with these assumptions. To overcome these limitations, we present Functional Retrofitting, a framework that generalizes current retrofitting methods by explicitly modeling pairwise relations. Our <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_framework">framework</a> can directly incorporate a variety of pairwise penalty functions previously developed for knowledge graph completion. Further, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_technology">it</a> allows users to encode, learn, and extract information about relation semantics. We present both linear and neural instantiations of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_framework">framework</a>. Functional Retrofitting significantly outperforms existing retrofitting methods on complex knowledge graphs and loses no accuracy on simpler graphs (in which relations do imply similarity). Finally, we demonstrate the utility of the framework by predicting new drugdisease treatment pairs in a large, complex health knowledge graph.</abstract>

Inspired by the existing studies, this paper proposed the static and dynamic attention based approaches for context-sensitive generation of open-domain conversational responses. Experimental results on two public datasets show that the proposed static attention based approach outperforms all the baselines on automatic and human evaluation.</abstract>

      <abstract>In this paper, we first utilize the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_embedding">word embedding</a> that focuses on sub-word units to the Mongolian Phrase Break (PB) prediction task by using Long-Short-Term-Memory (LSTM) model. Mongolian is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agglutinative_language">agglutinative language</a>. Each root can be followed by several suffixes to form probably millions of words, but the existing Mongolian corpus is not enough to build a robust entire <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_embedding">word embedding</a>, thus it suffers a serious data sparse problem and brings a great difficulty for Mongolian PB prediction. To solve this problem, we look at sub-word units in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongolian_language">Mongolian word</a>, and encode their information to a meaningful representation, then fed it to LSTM to decode the best corresponding PB label. Experimental results show that the proposed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model">model</a> significantly outperforms traditional CRF model using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_(machine_learning)">manually features</a> and obtains 7.49 % F-Measure gain.</abstract>

      <abstract>This paper describes CzEngClass, a bilingual lexical resource being built to investigate verbal synonymy in bilingual context and to relate semantic roles common to one synonym class to verb arguments (verb valency). In addition, the resource is linked to existing resources with the same of a similar aim : <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language">English and Czech WordNet</a>, FrameNet, PropBank, VerbNet (SemLink), and valency lexicons for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czech_language">Czech</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language">English</a> (PDT-Vallex, Vallex, and EngVallex). There are several goals of this work and resource : (a) to provide gold standard data for automatic experiments in the future (such as automatic discovery of synonym classes, word sense disambiguation, assignment of classes to occurrences of verbs in text, coreferential linking of verb and event arguments in text, etc.), (b) to build a core (bilingual) lexicon linked to existing resources, for comparative studies and possibly for training automatic tools, and (c) to enrich the annotation of a parallel treebank, the Prague Czech English Dependency Treebank, which so far contained valency annotation but has not linked synonymous senses of verbs together. The method used for extracting the synonym classes is a semi-automatic process with a substantial amount of manual work during filtering, role assignment to classes and individual Class members’ arguments, and linking to the external lexical resources. We present the first version with 200 classes (about 1800 verbs) and evaluate interannotator agreement using several <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_(mathematics)">metrics</a>.</abstract>

      <abstract>Due to the fact that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_language">Korean</a> is a highly agglutinative, character-rich language, previous work on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_language">Korean morphological analysis</a> typically employs the use of sub-character features known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grapheme">graphemes</a> or otherwise utilizes comprehensive prior linguistic knowledge (i.e., a dictionary of known morphological transformation forms, or actions). These models have been created with the assumption that character-level, dictionary-less morphological analysis was intractable due to the number of actions required. We present, in this study, a multi-stage action-based model that can perform morphological transformation and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Part-of-speech_tagging">part-of-speech tagging</a> using arbitrary units of input and apply it to the case of character-level Korean morphological analysis.

In this study, we use on-line Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to model shifts in topics, and apply on-line change point detection (CPD) algorithms to detect when significant changes happen. We describe an on-line Bayesian change point detection algorithm that we use to detect topic changes from on-line LDA output. Extensive experiments on social media data and news articles show the benefits of on-line LDA versus standard LDA, and of on-line change point detection compared to off-line algorithms. This yields F-scores up to 52 % on the detection of significant real-life changes from these document streams.</abstract>

      <abstract>In this paper we use methods for creating a large lexicon of verbal polarity shifters and apply them to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_language">German</a>. Polarity shifters are content words that can move the polarity of a phrase towards its opposite, such as the verb abandon in abandon all hope. This is similar to how <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affirmation_and_negation">negation words</a> like not can influence <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affirmation_and_negation">polarity</a>. Both shifters and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negation">negation</a> are required for high precision sentiment analysis. Lists of negation words are available for many languages, but the only language for which a sizable lexicon of verbal polarity shifters exists is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language">English</a>. This <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexicon">lexicon</a> was created by bootstrapping a sample of annotated verbs with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supervised_learning">supervised classifier</a> that uses a set of data- and resource-driven features. We reproduce and adapt this approach to create a German lexicon of verbal polarity shifters. Thereby, we confirm that the approach works for multiple languages. We further improve <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Categorization">classification</a> by leveraging cross-lingual information from the English shifter lexicon. Using this improved approach, we bootstrap a large number of German verbal polarity shifters, reducing the annotation effort drastically. The resulting German lexicon of verbal polarity shifters is made publicly available.</abstract>

      <abstract>Question-Answer (QA) matching is a fundamental task in the Natural Language Processing community. In this paper, we first build a novel QA matching corpus with informal text which is collected from a product reviewing website. Then, we propose a novel QA matching approach, namely One vs. Many Matching, which aims to address the novel scenario where one question sentence often has an answer with multiple sentences. Furthermore, we improve our matching approach by employing both word-level and sentence-level attentions for solving the noisy problem in the informal text. Empirical studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach to question-answer matching.</abstract>

      <abstract>Multiword expressions, especially verbal ones (VMWEs), show idiosyncratic variability, which is challenging for NLP applications, hence the need for VMWE identification. We focus on the task of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variation_(linguistics)">variant identification</a>, i.e. identifying variants of previously seen VMWEs, whatever their surface form. We model the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_solving">problem</a> as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_classification">classification task</a>. Syntactic subtrees with previously seen combinations of lemmas are first extracted, and then classified on the basis of features relevant to morpho-syntactic variation of VMWEs. Feature values are both absolute, i.e. hold for a particular VMWE candidate, and relative, i.e. based on comparing a candidate with previously seen VMWEs. This approach outperforms a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseline_(surveying)">baseline</a> by 4 percent points of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-measure">F-measure</a> on a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language">French corpus</a>.</abstract>

We present a method to choose the contextual correct definition of an acronym that does not require training for each <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acronym">acronym</a> and thus can be applied to a large number of different <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acronym">acronyms</a> with only few instances. We constructed a set of 19,954 examples of 4,365 ambiguous acronyms from image captions in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_literature">scientific papers</a> along with their contextually correct definition from different domains. We learn word embeddings for all words in the corpus and compare the averaged context vector of the words in the expansion of an acronym with the weighted average vector of the words in the context of the acronym. We show that this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methodology">method</a> clearly outperforms (classical) cosine similarity. Furthermore, we show that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_embedding">word embeddings</a> learned from a 1 billion word corpus of scientific texts outperform <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_embedding">word embeddings</a> learned on much large general corpora.</abstract>

While this has been solved for the widely-used languages, this is still a challenge for the languages in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bantu_languages">Bantu language family</a>. Pluralization results obtained for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zulu_language">isiZulu</a> and Runyankore showed there were similarities in approach, including the need to combine <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntax">syntax</a> with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantics">semantics</a>, despite belonging to different language zones. This suggests that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrapping">bootstrapping</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalizability">generalizability</a> might be feasible. We investigated this systematically for seven languages across three different <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guthrie_classification">Guthrie language zones</a>. The first outcome is that Meinhof’s 1948 specification of the noun classes are indeed inadequate for computational purposes for all examined languages, due to non-determinism in prefixes, and we thus redefined the characteristic noun class tables of 29 noun classes into 53. The second main result is that the generic pluralizer achieved over 93 % <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision">accuracy</a> in coverage testing and over 94 % on a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(statistics)">random sample</a>.

      <abstract>Commonsense, real-world knowledge about the events that entities or things in the world are typically involved in, as well as part-whole relationships, is valuable for allowing computational systems to draw everyday inferences about the world. Here, we focus on automatically extracting information about (1) the events that typically bring about certain entities (origins), (2) the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_(probability_theory)">events</a> that are the typical functions of entities, and (3) part-whole relationships in entities. These correspond to the agentive, telic and constitutive qualia central to the Generative Lexicon. We describe our motivations and methods for extracting these qualia relations from the Suggested Upper Merged Ontology (SUMO) and show that human annotators overwhelmingly find the information extracted to be reasonable. Because <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology_(information_science)">ontologies</a> provide a way of structuring this information and making it accessible to agents and computational systems generally, efforts are underway to incorporate the extracted information to an ontology hub of Natural Language Processing semantic role labeling resources, the Rich Event Ontology.</abstract>

      <abstract>Formulaic expressions (FEs) used in scholarly papers, such as ‘there has been little discussion about’, are helpful for non-native English speakers. However, it is time-consuming for users to manually search for an appropriate expression every time they want to consult FE dictionaries. For this reason, we tackle the task of semantic searches of FE dictionaries. At the start of our research, we identified two salient difficulties in this task. First, the paucity of example sentences in existing FE dictionaries results in a shortage of context information, which is necessary for acquiring semantic representation of FEs. Second, while a semantic category label is assigned to each FE in many FE dictionaries, it is difficult to predict the labels from user input, forcing users to manually designate the semantic category when searching. To address these difficulties, we propose a new framework for semantic searches of FEs and propose a new method to leverage both existing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictionary">dictionaries</a> and domain sentence corpora. Further, we expand an existing FE dictionary to consider building a more comprehensive and domain-specific FE dictionary and to verify the effectiveness of our method.</abstract>

We present a new approach based on scaled-up qualitative analysis of word vector neighborhoods that quantifies interpretable characteristics of a given <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_model">model</a> (e.g. its preference for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synonym">synonyms</a> or shared morphological forms as nearest neighbors). We analyze 21 such factors and show how they correlate with performance on 14 extrinsic and intrinsic task datasets (and also explain the lack of correlation between some of them). Our approach enables multi-faceted evaluation, parameter search, and generally   a more principled, hypothesis-driven approach to development of distributional semantic representations.</abstract>

      <abstract>Word sense disambiguation (WSD) is the task to determine the word sense according to its context. Many existing WSD studies have been using an external knowledge-based unsupervised approach because it has fewer word set constraints than supervised approaches requiring training data. In this paper, we propose a new WSD method to generate the context of an ambiguous word by using similarities between an ambiguous word and words in the input document. In addition, to leverage our WSD method, we further propose a new word similarity calculation method based on the semantic network structure of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BabelNet">BabelNet</a>. We evaluate the proposed methods on the SemEval-13 and SemEval-15 for English WSD dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed WSD method significantly improves the baseline WSD method. Furthermore, our WSD system outperforms the state-of-the-art WSD systems in the Semeval-13 dataset. Finally, it has higher performance than the state-of-the-art unsupervised knowledge-based WSD system in the average performance of both datasets.</abstract>

      <abstract>In this paper, we propose a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_(computer_programming)">method</a> for obtaining sentence-level embeddings. While the problem of securing word-level embeddings is very well studied, we propose a novel method for obtaining sentence-level embeddings. This is obtained by a simple method in the context of solving the paraphrase generation task. If we use a sequential encoder-decoder model for generating <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paraphrase">paraphrase</a>, we would like the generated <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paraphrase">paraphrase</a> to be semantically close to the original sentence. One way to ensure this is by adding constraints for true paraphrase embeddings to be close and unrelated paraphrase candidate sentence embeddings to be far. This is ensured by using a sequential pair-wise discriminator that shares weights with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encoder">encoder</a> that is trained with a suitable <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loss_function">loss function</a>. Our <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loss_function">loss function</a> penalizes paraphrase sentence embedding distances from being too large. This <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lossless_compression">loss</a> is used in combination with a sequential encoder-decoder network. We also validated our method by evaluating the obtained <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embedding">embeddings</a> for a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentiment_analysis">sentiment analysis task</a>. The proposed method results in semantic embeddings and outperforms the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_the_art">state-of-the-art</a> on the paraphrase generation and sentiment analysis task on standard datasets. These results are also shown to be statistically significant.</abstract>

      <abstract>Several metrics have been proposed for evaluating grammatical error correction (GEC) systems based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammaticality">grammaticality</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluency">fluency</a>, and adequacy of the output sentences. Previous studies of the correlation of these <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_(mathematics)">metrics</a> with human quality judgments were inconclusive, due to the lack of appropriate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance">significance tests</a>, discrepancies in the methods, and choice of datasets used. In this paper, we re-evaluate reference-based GEC metrics by measuring the system-level correlations with humans on a large dataset of human judgments of GEC outputs, and by properly conducting statistical significance tests. Our results show no significant advantage of GLEU over MaxMatch (M2), contradicting previous studies that claim GLEU to be superior. For a finer-grained analysis, we additionally evaluate these <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_(mathematics)">metrics</a> for their agreement with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judgement">human judgments</a> at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentence_(linguistics)">sentence level</a>. Our sentence-level analysis indicates that comparing GLEU and M2, one <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_(mathematics)">metric</a> may be more useful than the other depending on the scenario. We further qualitatively analyze these metrics and our findings show that apart from being less interpretable and non-deterministic, GLEU also produces counter-intuitive scores in commonly occurring test examples.</abstract>

      <abstract>While much progress has been made in how to encode a text sequence into a sequence of vectors, less attention has been paid to how to aggregate these preceding vectors (outputs of RNN / CNN) into fixed-size encoding vector. Usually, a simple max or average pooling is used, which is a bottom-up and passive way of aggregation and lack of guidance by task information. In this paper, we propose an aggregation mechanism to obtain a fixed-size encoding with a dynamic routing policy. The dynamic routing policy is dynamically deciding that what and how much information need be transferred from each word to the final encoding of the text sequence. Following the work of Capsule Network, we design two dynamic routing policies to aggregate the outputs of RNN / CNN encoding layer into a final encoding vector. Compared to the other aggregation methods, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_routing">dynamic routing</a> can refine the messages according to the state of final encoding vector. Experimental results on five text classification tasks show that our method outperforms other aggregating models by a significant margin. Related source code is released on our github page.

      <abstract>Semantic role labeling (SRL) is to recognize the predicate-argument structure of a sentence, including subtasks of predicate disambiguation and argument labeling. Previous studies usually formulate the entire SRL problem into two or more subtasks. For the first time, this paper introduces an end-to-end neural model which unifiedly tackles the predicate disambiguation and the argument labeling in one shot. Using a biaffine scorer, our model directly predicts all semantic role labels for all given word pairs in the sentence without relying on any syntactic parse information. Specifically, we augment the BiLSTM encoder with a non-linear transformation to further distinguish the predicate and the argument in a given sentence, and model the semantic role labeling process as a word pair classification task by employing the biaffine attentional mechanism. Though the proposed model is syntax-agnostic with local decoder, it outperforms the state-of-the-art syntax-aware SRL systems on the CoNLL-2008, 2009 benchmarks for both <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language">English</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_language">Chinese</a>. To our best knowledge, we report the first syntax-agnostic SRL model that surpasses all known syntax-aware models.</abstract>

      <abstract>The rapid growth of documents across the web has necessitated finding means of discarding redundant documents and retaining novel ones. Capturing redundancy is challenging as it may involve investigating at a deep semantic level. Techniques for detecting such semantic redundancy at the document level are scarce. In this work we propose a deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) based model to classify a document as novel or redundant with respect to a set of relevant documents already seen by the system. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System">system</a> is simple and do not require any manual feature engineering. Our novel scheme encodes relevant and relative information from both source and target texts to generate an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermediate_representation">intermediate representation</a> which we coin as the Relative Document Vector (RDV). The proposed method outperforms the existing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_the_art">state-of-the-art</a> on a document-level novelty detection dataset by a margin of 5 % in terms of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision">accuracy</a>. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a standard paraphrase detection dataset where paraphrased passages closely resemble to semantically redundant documents.</abstract>

      <abstract>Authorship attribution typically uses all information representing both content and style whereas <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attribution_(copyright)">attribution</a> based only on stylistic aspects may be robust in cross-domain settings. This paper analyzes different linguistic aspects that may help represent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Style_(manner_of_address)">style</a>. Specifically, we study the role of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntax">syntax</a> and lexical words (nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs) in representing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Style_(sociolinguistics)">style</a>. We use a purely syntactic language model to study the significance of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentence_(linguistics)">sentence structures</a> in both single-domain and cross-domain attribution, i.e. cross-topic and cross-genre attribution. We show that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntax">syntax</a> may be helpful for cross-genre attribution while cross-topic attribution and single-domain may benefit from additional lexical information. Further, pure syntactic models may not be effective by themselves and need to be used in combination with other robust models. To study the role of word choice, we perform attribution by masking all words or specific topic words corresponding to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noun">nouns</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verb">verbs</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjective">adjectives</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverb">adverbs</a>. Using a single-domain dataset, IMDB1 M reviews, we demonstrate the heavy influence of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proper_noun">common nouns</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proper_noun">proper nouns</a> in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attribution_(psychology)">attribution</a>, thereby highlighting topic interference. Using cross-domain Guardian10 dataset, we show that some common nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs may help with stylometric attribution as demonstrated by masking topic words corresponding to these <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Part_of_speech">parts-of-speech</a>. As expected, it was observed that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proper_noun">proper nouns</a> are heavily influenced by content and cross-domain attribution will benefit from completely masking them.</abstract>

      <abstract>Word composition is a promising technique for representation learning of large linguistic units (e.g., phrases, sentences and documents). However, most of the current composition models do not take the ambiguity of words and the context outside of a linguistic unit into consideration for learning representations, and consequently suffer from the inaccurate representation of semantics. To address this issue, we propose a model-free context-aware word composition model, which employs the latent semantic information as global context for learning representations. The proposed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_model">model</a> attempts to resolve the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word-sense_disambiguation">word sense disambiguation</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composition_(language)">word composition</a> in a unified framework. Extensive evaluation shows consistent improvements over various strong word representation / composition models at different granularities (including word, phrase and sentence), demonstrating the effectiveness of our proposed method.</abstract>

      <abstract>Representing a word by its co-occurrences with other words in context is an effective way to capture the meaning of the word. However, the theory behind remains a challenge. In this work, taking the example of a word classification task, we give a theoretical analysis of the approaches that represent a word X by a function f(P(C|X)), where C is a context feature, P(C|X) is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditional_probability">conditional probability</a> estimated from a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_corpus">text corpus</a>, and the function f maps the co-occurrence measure to a prediction score. We investigate the impact of context feature C and the function f. We also explain the reasons why using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Co-occurrence">co-occurrences</a> with multiple context features may be better than just using a single one. In addition, based on the analysis, we propose a hypothesis about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditional_probability">conditional probability</a> on zero probability events.</abstract>

We propose a new neural network approach to ERM that not only outperforms the previous state-of-the-art. Equally important, we present a refined evaluation methodology and gather strong evidence that our model yields results which are (almost) as reliable as human annotations, even in cross-lingual settings. Based on these results we generate new emotion ratings for 13 typologically diverse languages and claim that they have near-gold quality, at least.</abstract>

      <abstract>Recurrent neural networks have achieved great success in many NLP tasks. However, they have difficulty in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_computing">parallelization</a> because of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrent_neural_network">recurrent structure</a>, so it takes much time to train <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrent_neural_network">RNNs</a>. In this paper, we introduce sliced recurrent neural networks (SRNNs), which could be parallelized by slicing the sequences into many subsequences. SRNNs have the ability to obtain high-level information through multiple layers with few extra parameters. We prove that the standard RNN is a special case of the SRNN when we use linear activation functions. Without changing the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrent_neural_network">recurrent units</a>, SRNNs are 136 times as fast as standard <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrent_neural_network">RNNs</a> and could be even faster when we train longer sequences. Experiments on six large-scale sentiment analysis datasets show that SRNNs achieve better performance than standard RNNs.</abstract>

      <abstract>K-fold cross validation (CV) is a popular method for estimating the true performance of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning">machine learning models</a>, allowing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_selection">model selection</a> and parameter tuning. However, the very process of CV requires random partitioning of the data and so our performance estimates are in fact stochastic, with variability that can be substantial for natural language processing tasks. We demonstrate that these unstable estimates can not be relied upon for effective parameter tuning. The resulting tuned parameters are highly sensitive to how our data is partitioned, meaning that we often select sub-optimal parameter choices and have serious reproducibility issues. Instead, we propose to use the less variable J-K-fold CV, in which J independent K-fold cross validations are used to assess performance. Our main contributions are extending J-K-fold CV from performance estimation to parameter tuning and investigating how to choose J and K. We argue that variability is more important than bias for effective tuning and so advocate lower choices of K than are typically seen in the NLP literature and instead use the saved computation to increase J. To demonstrate the generality of our recommendations we investigate a wide range of case-studies : sentiment classification (both general and target-specific), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Part-of-speech_tagging">part-of-speech tagging</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_classification">document classification</a>.</abstract>

It has been a topic of research in different parts of the NLP community, mostly with focus on the specific topic at hand even though incremental systems have to deal with similar challenges regardless of domain. In this survey, I consolidate and categorize the approaches, identifying similarities and differences in the computation and data, and show trade-offs that have to be considered. A focus lies on evaluating incremental systems because the standard <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance_metric">metrics</a> often fail to capture the incremental properties of a system and coming up with a suitable evaluation scheme is non-trivial.</abstract>

      <abstract>Neural machine translation systems require a number of stacked layers for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning">deep models</a>. But the prediction depends on the sentence representation of the top-most layer with no access to low-level representations. This makes it more difficult to train the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model">model</a> and poses a risk of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_loss">information loss</a> to prediction. In this paper, we propose a multi-layer representation fusion (MLRF) approach to fusing stacked layers. In particular, we design three <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)">fusion functions</a> to learn a better representation from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_stack">stack</a>. Experimental results show that our approach yields improvements of 0.92 and 0.56 BLEU points over the strong Transformer baseline on IWSLT German-English and NIST Chinese-English MT tasks respectively. The result is new state-of-the-art in German-English translation.</abstract>

      <abstract>To enrich vocabulary of low resource settings, we proposed a novel method which identify <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loanword">loanwords</a> in monolingual corpora. More specifically, we first use cross-lingual word embeddings as the core feature to generate semantically related candidates based on comparable corpora and a small bilingual lexicon ; then, a log-linear model which combines several shallow features such as pronunciation similarity and hybrid language model features to predict the final results. In this paper, we use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uyghur_language">Uyghur</a> as the receipt language and try to detect loanwords in four donor languages : <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic">Arabic</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_language">Chinese</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persian_language">Persian</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_language">Russian</a>. We conduct two groups of experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed approach : loanword identification and OOV translation in four language pairs and eight translation directions (Uyghur-Arabic, Arabic-Uyghur, Uyghur-Chinese, Chinese-Uyghur, Uyghur-Persian, Persian-Uyghur, Uyghur-Russian, and Russian-Uyghur). Experimental results on loanword identification show that our method outperforms other baseline models significantly. Neural machine translation models integrating results of loanword identification experiments achieve the best results on OOV translation(with 0.5-0.9 BLEU improvements)</abstract>

      <abstract>In the popular sequence to sequence (seq2seq) neural machine translation (NMT), there exist many weighted sum models (WSMs), each of which takes a set of input and generates one output. However, the weights in a WSM are independent of each other and fixed for all inputs, suggesting that by ignoring different needs of inputs, the WSM lacks effective control on the influence of each input. In this paper, we propose adaptive weighting for WSMs to control the contribution of each input. Specifically, we apply adaptive weighting for both GRU and the output state in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_topology">NMT</a>. Experimentation on Chinese-to-English translation and English-to-German translation demonstrates that the proposed adaptive weighting is able to much improve <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision">translation accuracy</a> by achieving significant improvement of 1.49 and 0.92 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BLEU">BLEU points</a> for the two translation tasks. Moreover, we discuss in-depth on what type of information is encoded in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encoder">encoder</a> and how information influences the generation of target words in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code">decoder</a>.</abstract>

      <abstract>Encoder-decoder based Sequence to Sequence learning (S2S) has made remarkable progress in recent years. Different <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_architecture">network architectures</a> have been used in the encoder / decoder. Among them, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network">Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)</a> and Self Attention Networks (SAN) are the prominent ones. The two architectures achieve similar performances but use very different ways to encode and decode context : CNN use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_layer">convolutional layers</a> to focus on the local connectivity of the sequence, while SAN uses self-attention layers to focus on global semantics. In this work we propose Double Path Networks for Sequence to Sequence learning (DPN-S2S), which leverage the advantages of both models by using double path information fusion. During the encoding step, we develop a double path architecture to maintain the information coming from different paths with convolutional layers and self-attention layers separately. To effectively use the encoded context, we develop a gated attention fusion module and use it to automatically pick up the information needed during the decoding step, which is also a double path network. By deeply integrating the two <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_(graph_theory)">paths</a>, both types of information are combined and well exploited. Experiments show that our proposed method can significantly improve the performance of sequence to sequence learning over state-of-the-art systems.</abstract>

      <abstract>A morphologically complex word (MCW) is a hierarchical constituent with meaning-preserving subunits, so word-based models which rely on surface forms might not be powerful enough to translate such structures. When translating from morphologically rich languages (MRLs), a source word could be mapped to several words or even a full sentence on the target side, which means an MCW should not be treated as an atomic unit. In order to provide better translations for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_translation">MRLs</a>, we boost the existing neural machine translation (NMT) architecture with a double- channel encoder and a double-attentive decoder. The main goal targeted in this research is to provide richer information on the encoder side and redesign the decoder accordingly to benefit from such information. Our experimental results demonstrate that we could achieve our goal as the proposed model outperforms existing subword- and character-based architectures and showed significant improvements on translating from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_language">German</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_language">Russian</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_language">Turkish</a> into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language">English</a>.</abstract>

We introduce a domain similarity metric to evaluate the relevance between a sentence and an available entire domain dataset. The similarity of each sentence to the target domain is calculated with various methods. The computed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Similarity_measure">similarity</a> is then integrated into the training objective to weight sentences. The adaptation results on both IWSLT Chinese-English TED task and a task with only synthetic training parallel data show that our sentence weighting method is able to achieve an significant improvement over strong baselines.</abstract>

      <abstract>This paper presents a sequence to sequence (seq2seq) dependency parser by directly predicting the relative position of head for each given word, which therefore results in a truly end-to-end seq2seq dependency parser for the first time. Enjoying the advantage of seq2seq modeling, we enrich a series of embedding enhancement, including firstly introduced subword and node2vec augmentation. Meanwhile, we propose a beam search decoder with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(data_structure)">tree constraint</a> and subroot decomposition over the sequence to furthermore enhance our seq2seq parser.

      <abstract>Hierarchical Multiscale LSTM (Chung et. al., 2016) is a state-of-the-art <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_model">language model</a> that learns interpretable structure from character-level input. Such <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model">models</a> can provide fertile ground for (cognitive) computational linguistics studies. However, the high complexity of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_architecture">architecture</a>, training and implementations might hinder its applicability. We provide a detailed reproduction and ablation study of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_architecture">architecture</a>, shedding light on some of the potential caveats of re-purposing complex deep-learning architectures. We further show that simplifying certain aspects of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architecture">architecture</a> can in fact improve its performance. We also investigate the linguistic units (segments) learned by various levels of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_model">model</a>, and argue that their quality does not correlate with the overall performance of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_model">model</a> on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_model">language modeling</a>.</abstract>

      <abstract>Generating character-level features is an important step for achieving good results in various natural language processing tasks. To alleviate the need for human labor in generating hand-crafted features, methods that utilize neural architectures such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network">Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrent_neural_network">Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)</a> to automatically extract such <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_(machine_learning)">features</a> have been proposed and have shown great results. However, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN">CNN</a> generates position-independent features, and RNN is slow since it needs to process the characters sequentially. In this paper, we propose a novel method of using a densely connected network to automatically extract character-level features. The proposed method does not require any language or task specific assumptions, and shows robustness and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effectiveness">effectiveness</a> while being faster than CNN- or RNN-based methods. Evaluating this method on three sequence labeling tasks-slot tagging, Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging, and Named-Entity Recognition (NER)-we obtain state-of-the-art performance with a 96.62 F1-score and 97.73 % accuracy on slot tagging and POS tagging, respectively, and comparable performance to the state-of-the-art 91.13 F1-score on NER.</abstract>

      <abstract>This study proposes a new neural machine translation (NMT) model based on the encoder-decoder model that incorporates named entity (NE) tags of source-language sentences. Conventional NMT models have two problems enumerated as follows : (i) they tend to have difficulty in translating words with multiple meanings because of the high ambiguity, and (ii) these models’abilitytotranslatecompoundwordsseemschallengingbecausetheencoderreceivesaword, a part of the compound word, at each time step. To alleviate these problems, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encoder">encoder</a> of the proposed model encodes the input word on the basis of its NE tag at each time step, which could reduce the ambiguity of the input word. Furthermore, the encoder introduces a chunk-level LSTM layer over a word-level LSTM layer and hierarchically encodes a source-language sentence to capture a compound NE as a chunk on the basis of the NE tags. We evaluate the proposed model on an English-to-Japanese translation task with the ASPEC, and English-to-Bulgarian and English-to-Romanian translation tasks with the Europarl corpus. The evaluation results show that the proposed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model">model</a> achieves up to 3.11 point improvement in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BLEU">BLEU</a>.</abstract>

      <abstract>Technical support problems are very complex. In contrast to regular web queries (that contain few keywords) or factoid questions (which are a few sentences), these problems usually include attributes like a detailed description of what is failing (symptom), steps taken in an effort to remediate the failure (activity), and sometimes a specific request or ask (intent). Automating support is the task of automatically providing answers to these problems given a corpus of solution documents. Traditional approaches to this task rely on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_retrieval">information retrieval</a> and are keyword based ; looking for keyword overlap between the question and solution documents and ignoring these attributes. We present an approach for semantic parsing of technical questions that uses grammatical structure to extract these attributes as a baseline, and a CRF based model that can improve performance considerably in the presence of annotated data for training. We also demonstrate that combined with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reason">reasoning</a>, these <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_and_attribute_(research)">attributes</a> help outperform retrieval baselines.</abstract>

      <abstract>A great proportion of sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) models for Neural Machine Translation (NMT) adopt Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to generate translation word by word following a sequential order. As the studies of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistics">linguistics</a> have proved that language is not linear word sequence but sequence of complex structure, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation">translation</a> at each step should be conditioned on the whole target-side context. To tackle the problem, we propose a new NMT model that decodes the sequence with the guidance of its structural prediction of the context of the target sequence. Our model generates <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation_(biology)">translation</a> based on the structural prediction of the target-side context so that the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation_(biology)">translation</a> can be freed from the bind of sequential order. Experimental results demonstrate that our <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model">model</a> is more competitive compared with the state-of-the-art methods, and the analysis reflects that our <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model">model</a> is also robust to translating sentences of different lengths and it also reduces <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repetition_(rhetorical_device)">repetition</a> with the instruction from the target-side context for decoding.</abstract>

      <abstract>Question Answering over Knowledge Bases (KB-QA), which automatically answer natural language questions based on the facts contained by a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_base">knowledge base</a>, is one of the most important natural language processing (NLP) tasks. Simple questions constitute a large part of questions queried on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web">web</a>, still being a challenge to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_assurance">QA systems</a>. In this work, we propose to conduct pattern extraction and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity–relationship_model">entity linking</a> first, and put forward pattern revising procedure to mitigate the error propagation problem. In order to learn to rank candidate subject-predicate pairs to enable the relevant facts retrieval given a question, we propose to do joint fact selection enhanced by relation detection. Multi-level encodings and multi-dimension information are leveraged to strengthen the whole procedure.

      <abstract>The most approaches to Knowledge Base Question Answering are based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_parsing">semantic parsing</a>. In this paper, we address the problem of learning vector representations for complex semantic parses that consist of multiple entities and relations. Previous work largely focused on selecting the correct semantic relations for a question and disregarded the structure of the semantic parse : the connections between entities and the directions of the relations. We propose to use Gated Graph Neural Networks to encode the graph structure of the semantic parse. We show on two <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_set">data sets</a> that the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(discrete_mathematics)">graph networks</a> outperform all baseline models that do not explicitly model the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(discrete_mathematics)">structure</a>.

An important step to analyze the discussions on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media">social media</a> and to assist in healthy decision-making is stance detection. This paper presents an approach to detect the stance of a user toward a topic based on their stances toward other topics and the social media posts of the user. We apply factorization machines, a widely used method in item recommendation, to model user preferences toward topics from the social media data. The experimental results demonstrate that users’ posts are useful to model topic preferences and therefore predict stances of silent users.</abstract>

Second, we conduct a set of learning experiments to build accurate fake news detectors, and show that we can achieve accuracies of up to 76 %. In addition, we provide comparative analyses of the automatic and manual identification of fake news.</abstract>

In previous work, these steps in the process of rumour verification have been developed as separate components where the output of one feeds into the next. We propose a multi-task learning approach that allows joint training of the main and auxiliary tasks, improving the performance of rumour verification.

      <abstract>Open Information Extraction (OIE) is the task of the unsupervised creation of structured information from text. OIE is often used as a starting point for a number of downstream tasks including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_base">knowledge base construction</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relation_extraction">relation extraction</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Question_answering">question answering</a>. While OIE methods are targeted at being domain independent, they have been evaluated primarily on newspaper, encyclopedic or general web text. In this article, we evaluate the performance of OIE on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_literature">scientific texts</a> originating from 10 different disciplines. To do so, we use two state-of-the-art OIE systems using a crowd-sourcing approach. We find that OIE systems perform significantly worse on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_literature">scientific text</a> than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encyclopedia">encyclopedic text</a>. We also provide an error analysis and suggest areas of work to reduce errors. Our corpus of sentences and judgments are made available.</abstract>

      <abstract>Standard word embedding algorithms learn vector representations from large corpora of text documents in an unsupervised fashion. However, the quality of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_embedding">word embeddings</a> learned from these <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm">algorithms</a> is affected by the size of training data sets. Thus, applications of these <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm">algorithms</a> in domains with only moderate amounts of available data is limited. In this paper we introduce an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm">algorithm</a> that learns <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_embedding">word embeddings</a> jointly with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_classification">classifier</a>. Our <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm">algorithm</a> is called SWESA (Supervised Word Embeddings for Sentiment Analysis). SWESA leverages document label information to learn vector representations of words from a modest corpus of text documents by solving an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimization_problem">optimization problem</a> that minimizes a cost function with respect to both word embeddings and the weight vector used for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_classification">classification</a>.

      <abstract>Unsupervised pre-trained word embeddings are used effectively for many tasks in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing">natural language processing</a> to leverage unlabeled textual data. Often these <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embedding">embeddings</a> are either used as initializations or as fixed word representations for task-specific classification models. In this work, we extend our classification model’s task loss with an unsupervised auxiliary loss on the word-embedding level of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_model">model</a>. This is to ensure that the learned word representations contain both task-specific features, learned from the supervised loss component, and more general features learned from the unsupervised loss component. We evaluate our approach on the task of temporal relation extraction, in particular, narrative containment relation extraction from clinical records, and show that continued training of the embeddings on the unsupervised objective together with the task objective gives better task-specific embeddings, and results in an improvement over the state of the art on the THYME dataset, using only a general-domain part-of-speech tagger as linguistic resource.</abstract>

      <abstract>In this paper, we describe experiments designed to explore and evaluate the impact of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punctuation">punctuation marks</a> on the task of native language identification. Punctuation is specific to each language, and is part of the indicators that overtly represent the manner in which each language organizes and conveys information. Our experiments are organized in various set-ups : the usual multi-class classification for individual languages, also considering classification by language groups, across different proficiency levels, topics and even cross-corpus. The results support our hypothesis that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punctuation">punctuation marks</a> are persistent and robust indicators of the native language of the author, which do not diminish in influence even when a high proficiency level in a non-native language is achieved.</abstract>

      <abstract>The literature frequently addresses the differences in receptive and productive vocabulary, but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammar">grammar</a> is often left unacknowledged in second language acquisition studies. In this paper, we used two <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_corpus">corpora</a> to investigate the divergences in the behavior of pedagogically relevant grammatical structures in reception and production texts. We further improved the divergence scores observed in this investigation by setting a polarity to them that indicates whether there is overuse or underuse of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_structure">grammatical structure</a> by language learners. This led to the compilation of a language profile that was later combined with vocabulary and readability features for classifying reception and production texts in three classes : beginner, intermediate, and advanced. The results of the automatic classification task in both <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Production_(economics)">production</a> (0.872 of F-measure) and reception (0.942 of F-measure) were comparable to the current state of the art. We also attempted to automatically attribute a score to texts produced by learners, and the correlation results were encouraging, but there is still a good amount of room for improvement in this task. The developed language profile will serve as input for a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System">system</a> that helps <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_acquisition">language learners</a> to activate more of their passive knowledge in writing texts.</abstract>

      <abstract>Enterprise content writers are engaged in writing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_(literary_theory)">textual content</a> for various purposes. Often, the text being written may already be present in the enterprise corpus in the form of past articles and can be re-purposed for the current needs. In the absence of suitable tools, authors manually curate / create such content (sometimes from scratch) which reduces their productivity. To address this, we propose an automatic approach to generate an initial version of the author’s intended text based on an input content snippet. Starting with a set of extracted textual fragments related to the snippet based on the query words in it, the proposed approach builds the desired text from these fragment by simultaneously optimizing the information coverage, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relevance">relevance</a>, diversity and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coherence_(linguistics)">coherence</a> in the generated content.

      <abstract>Dialogue Act (DA) tagging is crucial for spoken language understanding systems, as it provides a general representation of speakers’ intents, not bound to a particular dialogue system. Unfortunately, publicly available data sets with DA annotation are all based on different annotation schemes and thus incompatible with each other. Moreover, their schemes often do not cover all aspects necessary for open-domain human-machine interaction. In this paper, we propose a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methodology">methodology</a> to map several publicly available corpora to a subset of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Organization_for_Standardization">ISO standard</a>, in order to create a large task-independent training corpus for DA classification. We show the feasibility of using this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_corpus">corpus</a> to train a domain-independent DA tagger testing it on out-of-domain conversational data, and argue the importance of training on multiple corpora to achieve robustness across different DA categories.</abstract>

To construct basic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntax_(programming_languages)">syntactic structure</a> (i.e., <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subject_(grammar)">subject</a>, predicate, and object), we use a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditional_random_field">Conditional Random Field</a> to label semantic representations (i.e., motions, objects).

      <abstract>This paper is an initial study on multi-task and multi-lingual joint learning for lexical utterance classification. A major problem in constructing lexical utterance classification modules for spoken dialogue systems is that individual data resources are often limited or unbalanced among tasks and/or languages. Various studies have examined joint learning using neural-network based shared modeling ; however, previous joint learning studies focused on either cross-task or cross-lingual knowledge transfer. In order to simultaneously support both multi-task and multi-lingual joint learning, our idea is to explicitly divide state-of-the-art neural lexical utterance classification into language-specific components that can be shared between different tasks and task-specific components that can be shared between different languages. In addition, in order to effectively transfer knowledge between different task data sets and different language data sets, this paper proposes a partially-shared modeling method that possesses both shared components and components specific to individual data sets. We demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed method using Japanese and English data sets with three different lexical utterance classification tasks.</abstract>

      <abstract>To deploy a spoken language understanding (SLU) model to a new language, language transferring is desired to avoid the trouble of acquiring and labeling a new big SLU corpus. An SLU corpus is a monolingual corpus with domain / intent / slot labels. Translating the original SLU corpus into the target language is an attractive strategy. However, SLU corpora consist of plenty of semantic labels (slots), which general-purpose translators can not handle well, not to mention additional culture differences. This paper focuses on the language transferring task given a small in-domain parallel SLU corpus. The in-domain parallel corpus can be used as the first adaptation on the general translator. But more importantly, we show how to use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning">reinforcement learning (RL)</a> to further adapt the adapted <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation">translator</a>, where translated sentences with more proper slot tags receive higher rewards. Our <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning">reward</a> is derived from the source input sentence exclusively, unlike <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning">reward</a> via actor-critical methods or computing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning">reward</a> with a ground truth target sentence. Hence we can adapt the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation">translator</a> the second time, using the big monolingual SLU corpus from the source language. We evaluate our approach on Chinese to English language transferring for SLU systems. The experimental results show that the generated English SLU corpus via adaptation and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning">reinforcement learning</a> gives us over 97 % in the slot F1 score and over 84 % accuracy in domain classification. It demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed language transferring method. Compared with naive translation, our proposed method improves domain classification accuracy by relatively 22 %, and the slot filling F1 score by relatively more than 71 %.</abstract>

In this paper, we study two types of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_relation">relation</a> : Event Coreference and Event Sequencing.

Empirically, our event coreference system has achieved state-of-the-art performance on the TAC-KBP 2015 event coreference task and our event sequencing system beats a strong temporal-based, oracle-informed baseline.

      <abstract>We present bot#1337 : a dialog system developed for the 1st NIPS Conversational Intelligence Challenge 2017 (ConvAI). The aim of the competition was to implement a bot capable of conversing with humans based on a given passage of text. To enable conversation, we implemented a set of skills for our <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_bot">bot</a>, including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chit-chat">chit-chat</a>, topic detection, text summarization, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Question_answering">question answering</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Question_answering">question generation</a>. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System">system</a> has been trained in a supervised setting using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialogue_manager">dialogue manager</a> to select an appropriate skill for generating a response. The latter allows a developer to focus on the skill implementation rather than the finite state machine based dialog manager. The proposed system bot#1337 won the competition with an average dialogue quality score of 2.78 out of 5 given by human evaluators. Source code and trained models for the bot#1337 are available on GitHub.</abstract>

      <abstract>We study the problem of grounding distributional representations of texts on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system">visual domain</a>, namely visual-semantic embeddings (VSE for short). Begin with an insightful adversarial attack on VSE embeddings, we show the limitation of current frameworks and image-text datasets (e.g., MS-COCO) both quantitatively and qualitatively. The large gap between the number of possible constitutions of real-world semantics and the size of parallel data, to a large extent, restricts the model to establish a strong link between textual semantics and visual concepts. We alleviate this problem by augmenting the MS-COCO image captioning datasets with textual contrastive adversarial samples. These samples are synthesized using language priors of human and the WordNet knowledge base, and enforce the model to ground learned embeddings to concrete concepts within the image. This simple but powerful technique brings a noticeable improvement over the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseline_(configuration_management)">baselines</a> on a diverse set of downstream tasks, in addition to defending known-type adversarial attacks.

However, understanding the stances expressed in these <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debate">debates</a> is a highly challenging task, which requires modeling both textual content and users’ conversational interactions.

      <abstract>Persuasion is rarely achieved through a loose set of arguments alone. Rather, an effective delivery of arguments follows a rhetorical strategy, combining <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_reasoning">logical reasoning</a> with appeals to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics">ethics</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotion">emotion</a>. We argue that such a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy">strategy</a> means to select, arrange, and phrase a set of argumentative discourse units. In this paper, we model rhetorical strategies for the computational synthesis of effective argumentation. In a study, we let 26 experts synthesize argumentative texts with different <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy">strategies</a> for 10 topics. We find that the experts agree in the selection significantly more when following the same <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy">strategy</a>. While the texts notably vary for different strategies, especially their arrangement remains stable. The results suggest that our <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model">model</a> enables a strategical synthesis.</abstract>

      <abstract>Classic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipeline_(software)">pipeline models</a> for task-oriented dialogue system require explicit modeling the dialogue states and hand-crafted action spaces to query a domain-specific knowledge base. Conversely, sequence-to-sequence models learn to map dialogue history to the response in current turn without explicit knowledge base querying. In this work, we propose a novel <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_framework">framework</a> that leverages the advantages of classic pipeline and sequence-to-sequence models. Our framework models a dialogue state as a fixed-size distributed representation and use this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_representation_and_reasoning">representation</a> to query a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_base">knowledge base</a> via an attention mechanism. Experiment on Stanford Multi-turn Multi-domain Task-oriented Dialogue Dataset shows that our framework significantly outperforms other sequence-to-sequence based baseline models on both automatic and human evaluation.</abstract>

      <abstract>Current paper explores the use of multi-view learning for search result clustering. A web-snippet can be represented using multiple views. Apart from textual view cued by both the semantic and syntactic information, a complimentary view extracted from images contained in the web-snippets is also utilized in the current framework. A single consensus partitioning is finally obtained after consulting these two individual views by the deployment of a multiobjective based clustering technique. Several objective functions including the values of a cluster quality measure measuring the goodness of partitionings obtained using different views and an agreement-disagreement index, quantifying the amount of oneness among multiple views in generating <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_of_a_set">partitionings</a> are optimized simultaneously using AMOSA. In order to detect the number of clusters automatically, concepts of variable length solutions and a vast range of permutation operators are introduced in the clustering process. Finally, a set of alternative partitioning are obtained on the final Pareto front by the proposed multi-view based multiobjective technique. Experimental results by the proposed approach on several benchmark test datasets of SRC with respect to different performance metrics evidently establish the power of visual and text-based views in achieving better search result clustering.</abstract>

Our dataset consists of 500 word-pairs annotated by 12 human subjects, and each pair has two distinct scores for similarity and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient_of_relationship">relatedness</a>. Word-pairs are selected to enable the evaluation of distributional semantic models by multiple attributes of words and word-pair relations such as frequency, morphology, concreteness and relation types (e.g., synonymy, antonymy). Our aim is to provide insights to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_model">semantic model</a> researchers by evaluating <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_model">models</a> in multiple attributes. We balance dataset word-pairs by their frequencies to evaluate the robustness of semantic models concerning out-of-vocabulary and rare words problems, which are caused by the rich derivational and inflectional morphology of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_language">Turkish language</a>.</abstract>

      <abstract>Most previous work in unsupervised semantic modeling in the presence of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metadata">metadata</a> has assumed that our goal is to make latent dimensions more correlated with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metadata">metadata</a>, but in practice the exact opposite is often true.

We introduce three <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_(mathematics)">metrics</a> for identifying topics that are highly correlated with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metadata">metadata</a>, and demonstrate that this problem affects between 30 and 50 % of the topics in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_model">models</a> trained on two real-world collections, regardless of the size of the model. We find that we can predict which words cause this phenomenon and that by selectively subsampling these words we dramatically reduce topic-metadata correlation, improve topic stability, and maintain or even improve model quality.</abstract>

      <abstract>Multi-label classification is an important yet challenging task in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing">natural language processing</a>. It is more complex than single-label classification in that the labels tend to be correlated. Existing methods tend to ignore the correlations between labels. Besides, different parts of the text can contribute differently for predicting different labels, which is not considered by existing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model">models</a>. In this paper, we propose to view the multi-label classification task as a sequence generation problem, and apply a sequence generation model with a novel decoder structure to solve it. Extensive experimental results show that our proposed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methodology">methods</a> outperform previous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_(physics)">work</a> by a substantial margin. Further analysis of experimental results demonstrates that the proposed methods not only capture the correlations between labels, but also select the most informative words automatically when predicting different labels.</abstract>

      <abstract>As the quantity of publications increases daily, researchers are forced to narrow their attention to their own specialism and are therefore less likely to make new connections with other areas. Literature based discovery (LBD) supports the identification of such connections. A number of LBD tools are available, however, they often suffer from limitations such as constraining possible searches or not producing results in real-time. We introduce HiDE (Hidden Discovery Explorer), an online knowledge browsing tool which allows fast access to hidden knowledge generated from all abstracts in Medline. HiDE is fast enough to allow users to explore the full range of hidden connections generated by an LBD system. The tool employs a novel combination of two approaches to LBD : a graph-based approach which allows hidden knowledge to be generated on a large scale and an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_inference">inference algorithm</a> to identify the most promising (most likely to be non trivial) information.

      <abstract>We present SetExpander, a corpus-based system for expanding a seed set of terms into a more complete set of terms that belong to the same <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_class">semantic class</a>. SetExpander implements an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workflow">iterative end-to end workflow</a> for term set expansion. It enables users to easily select a seed set of terms, expand <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_technology">it</a>, view the expanded set, validate it, re-expand the validated set and store it, thus simplifying the extraction of domain-specific fine-grained semantic classes. SetExpander has been used for solving real-life use cases including integration in an automated recruitment system and an issues and defects resolution system. A video demo of SetExpander is available at https://drive.google.com/open?id=1e545bB87Autsch36DjnJHmq3HWfSd1Rv.</abstract>

      <abstract>Language change across space and time is one of the main concerns in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_linguistics">historical linguistics</a>. In this paper, we develop a language evolution simulator : a web-based tool for word form production to assist in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_linguistics">historical linguistics</a>, in studying the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_linguistics">evolution of the languages</a>. Given a word in a source language, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System">system</a> automatically predicts how the word evolves in a target language. The method that we propose is language-agnostic and does not use any external knowledge, except for the training word pairs.</abstract>

      <abstract>In today’s globalized world we have the ability to communicate with people across the world. However, in many situations the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_barrier">language barrier</a> still presents a major issue. For example, many foreign students coming to KIT to study are initially unable to follow a lecture in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_language">German</a>. Therefore, we offer an automatic simultaneous interpretation service for students. To fulfill this task, we have developed a low-latency translation system that is adapted to lectures and covers several language pairs. While the switch from traditional <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_machine_translation">Statistical Machine Translation</a> to Neural Machine Translation (NMT) significantly improved performance, to integrate NMT into the speech translation framework required several adjustments. We have addressed the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_time_(program_lifecycle_phase)">run-time constraints</a> and different types of input. Furthermore, we utilized <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-shot_learning">one-shot learning</a> to easily add new topic-specific terms to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System">system</a>. Besides better performance, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-verbal_communication">NMT</a> also enabled us increase our covered languages through multilingual NMT. % Combining these techniques, we are able to provide an adapted speech translation system for several <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Languages_of_Europe">European languages</a>.</abstract>

      <abstract>Writing Mentor is a free Google Docs add-on designed to provide feedback to struggling writers and help them improve their writing in a self-paced and self-regulated fashion. Writing Mentor uses natural language processing (NLP) methods and resources to generate feedback in terms of features that research into post-secondary struggling writers has classified as developmental (Burstein et al., 2016b). These features span many writing sub-constructs (use of sources, claims, and evidence ; topic development ; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coherence_(linguistics)">coherence</a> ; and knowledge of English conventions). Prelimi- nary analysis indicates that users have a largely positive impression of Writing Mentor in terms of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usability">usability</a> and potential impact on their writing.</abstract>

      <abstract>We present WARP-Text, an open-source web-based tool for annotating relationships between pairs of texts. WARP-Text supports multi-layer annotation and custom definitions of inter-textual and intra-textual relationships. Annotation can be performed at different granularity levels (such as sentences, phrases, or tokens). WARP-Text has an intuitive user-friendly interface both for project managers and annotators. WARP-Text fills a gap in the currently available NLP toolbox, as open-source alternatives for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annotation">annotation</a> of pairs of text are not readily available. WARP-Text has already been used in several annotation tasks and can be of interest to the researchers working in the areas of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paraphrase">Paraphrasing</a>, Entailment, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplification">Simplification</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summarization">Summarization</a>, among others.</abstract>

We derive a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topic_model">topic model</a> based on nnDDC, which generates probability distributions over semantic units for any input on sense-, word- and text-level.
