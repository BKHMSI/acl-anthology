      <abstract>Twitter is a popular platform to share opinions and claims, which may be accompanied by the underlying rationale. Such information can be invaluable to policy makers, marketers and social scientists, to name a few. However, the effort to mine arguments on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter">Twitter</a> has been limited, mainly because a tweet is typically too short to contain an argument   both a claim and a premise. In this paper, we propose a novel problem formulation to mine arguments from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter">Twitter</a> : We formulate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_mining">argument mining</a> on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter">Twitter</a> as a text classification task to identify tweets that serve as premises for a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hashtag">hashtag</a> that represents a claim of interest. To demonstrate the efficacy of this formulation, we mine arguments for and against funding Planned Parenthood expressed in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter">tweets</a>. We first present a new dataset of 24,100 tweets containing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hashtag">hashtag</a> # StandWithPP or # DefundPP, manually labeled as SUPPORT WITH REASON, SUPPORT WITHOUT REASON, and NO EXPLICIT SUPPORT. We then train <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_classification">classifiers</a> to determine the types of tweets, achieving the best performance of 71 % F1. Our results manifest claim-specific keywords as the most informative features, which in turn reveal prominent arguments for and against funding Planned Parenthood.</abstract>

      <abstract>When assessing the similarity of arguments, researchers typically use approaches that do not provide interpretable evidence or justifications for their ratings. Hence, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_(linguistics)">features</a> that determine argument similarity remain elusive. We address this issue by introducing novel argument similarity metrics that aim at high performance and explainability. We show that Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) graphs can be useful for representing arguments, and that novel AMR graph metrics can offer explanations for argument similarity ratings. We start from the hypothesis that similar premises often lead to similar conclusionsand extend an approach for AMR-based argument similarity rating by estimating, in addition, the similarity of conclusions that we automatically infer from the arguments used as premises. We show that AMR similarity metrics make argument similarity judgements more interpretable and may even support argument quality judgements. Our approach provides significant performance improvements over strong <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseline_(configuration_management)">baselines</a> in a fully unsupervised setting. Finally, we make first steps to address the problem of reference-less evaluation of argumentative conclusion generations.<i>novel argument similarity metrics</i> that aim at high performance and explainability.

      <abstract>The premises of an argument give evidence or other reasons to support a conclusion. However, the amount of support required depends on the generality of a conclusion, the nature of the individual premises, and similar. An argument whose premises make its conclusion rationally worthy to be drawn is called sufficient in argument quality research. Previous work tackled sufficiency assessment as a standard text classification problem, not modeling the inherent relation of premises and conclusion. In this paper, we hypothesize that the conclusion of a sufficient argument can be generated from its premises. To study this hypothesis, we explore the potential of assessing sufficiency based on the output of large-scale pre-trained language models. Our best model variant achieves an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-number">F1-score</a> of.885, outperforming the previous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_the_art">state-of-the-art</a> and being on par with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expert">human experts</a>. While manual evaluation reveals the quality of the generated conclusions, their impact remains low ultimately.</abstract>

      <abstract>We propose a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methodology">methodology</a> for representing the reasoning structure of arguments using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_network">Bayesian networks</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-order_logic">predicate logic</a> facilitated by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argumentation_theory">argumentation schemes</a>. We express the meaning of text segments using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-order_logic">predicate logic</a> and map the boolean values of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-order_logic">predicate logic expressions</a> to nodes in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_network">Bayesian network</a>. The reasoning structure among text segments is described with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph">directed acyclic graph</a>. While our <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formalism_(philosophy_of_mathematics)">formalism</a> is highly expressive and capable of describing the informal logic of human arguments, it is too open-ended to actually build a network for an argument. It is not at all obvious which segment of argumentative text should be considered as a node in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_network">Bayesian network</a>, and how to decide the dependencies among nodes. To alleviate the difficulty, we provide abstract network fragments, called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiom_(language_structure)">idioms</a>, which represent typical argument justification patterns derived from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argumentation_theory">argumentation schemes</a>. The network construction process is decomposed into idiom selection, idiom instantiation, and idiom combination. We define 17 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiom_(language_structure)">idioms</a> in total by referring to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argumentation_theory">argumentation schemes</a> as well as analyzing actual arguments and fitting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiom_(language_structure)">idioms</a> to them. We also create a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_set">dataset</a> consisting of pairs of an argumentative text and a corresponding <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_network">Bayesian network</a>. Our <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_set">dataset</a> contains about 2,400 pairs, which is large in the research area of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argumentation_theory">argumentation schemes</a>.</abstract>

      <abstract>Human moderation is commonly employed in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deliberation">deliberative contexts</a> (argumentation and discussion targeting a shared decision on an issue relevant to a group, e.g., citizens arguing on how to employ a shared budget). As the scale of discussion enlarges in online settings, the overall discussion quality risks to drop and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moderation">moderation</a> becomes more important to assist participants in having a cooperative and productive interaction. The scale also makes it more important to employ <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuro-linguistic_programming">NLP methods</a> for(semi-)automatic moderation, e.g. to prioritize when <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moderation">moderation</a> is most needed. In this work, we make the first steps towards (semi-)automatic moderation by using state-of-the-art classification models to predict which posts require <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moderation_system">moderation</a>, showing that while the task is undoubtedly difficult, performance is significantly above baseline. We further investigate whether argument quality is a key indicator of the need for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moderation">moderation</a>, showing that surprisingly, high quality arguments also trigger <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moderation">moderation</a>. We make our code and data publicly available.</abstract>

      <abstract>Key Point Analysis (KPA) is one of the most essential tasks in building an Opinion Summarization system, which is capable of generating key points for a collection of arguments toward a particular topic. Furthermore, KPA allows quantifying the coverage of each summary by counting its matched arguments. With the aim of creating high-quality summaries, it is necessary to have an in-depth understanding of each individual argument as well as its universal semantic in a specified context. In this paper, we introduce a promising model, named Matching the Statements (MTS) that incorporates the discussed topic information into arguments / key points comprehension to fully understand their meanings, thus accurately performing ranking and retrieving best-match key points for an input argument. Our approach has achieved the 4th place in Track 1 of the Quantitative Summarization   Key Point Analysis Shared Task by IBM, yielding a competitive performance of 0.8956 (3rd) and 0.9632 (7th) strict and relaxed mean Average Precision, respectively.</abstract>
