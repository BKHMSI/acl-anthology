      <abstract>We propose a touch-based editing method for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation">translation</a>, which is more flexible than traditional keyboard-mouse-based translation postediting. This approach relies on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somatosensory_system">touch actions</a> that users perform to indicate translation errors. We present a dual-encoder model to handle the actions and generate refined translations. To mimic the user feedback, we adopt the TER algorithm comparing between draft translations and references to automatically extract the simulated actions for training data construction. Experiments on translation datasets with simulated editing actions show that our <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_(computer_programming)">method</a> significantly improves original translation of Transformer (up to 25.31 BLEU) and outperforms existing interactive translation methods (up to 16.64 BLEU). We also conduct experiments on post-editing dataset to further prove the robustness and effectiveness of our <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methodology">method</a>.</abstract>

      <abstract>Multilingual pretrained language models (such as multilingual BERT) have achieved impressive results for cross-lingual transfer. However, due to the constant model capacity, multilingual pre-training usually lags behind the monolingual competitors. In this work, we present two approaches to improve zero-shot cross-lingual classification, by transferring the knowledge from monolingual pretrained models to multilingual ones. Experimental results on two cross-lingual classification benchmarks show that our methods outperform vanilla multilingual fine-tuning.</abstract>

      <abstract>Unlike non-conversation scenes, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotion_recognition">emotion recognition</a> in dialogues (ERD) poses more complicated challenges due to its interactive nature and intricate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Context_(language_use)">contextual information</a>. All present methods model historical utterances without considering the content of the target utterance. However, different parts of a historical utterance may contribute differently to emotion inference of different target utterances. Therefore we propose Fine-grained Extraction and Reasoning Network (FERNet) to generate target-specific historical utterance representations. The reasoning module effectively handles both local and global sequential dependencies to reason over context, and updates target utterance representations to more informed vectors. Experiments on two <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benchmark_(computing)">benchmarks</a> show that our <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_(computer_programming)">method</a> achieves competitive performance compared with previous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_(computer_programming)">methods</a>.</abstract>

      <abstract>The recently introduced pre-trained language model BERT advances the state-of-the-art on many NLP tasks through the fine-tuning approach, but few studies investigate how the fine-tuning process improves the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model">model</a> performance on downstream tasks. In this paper, we inspect the learning dynamics of BERT fine-tuning with two indicators. We use JS divergence to detect the change of the attention mode and use SVCCA distance to examine the change to the feature extraction mode during BERT fine-tuning. We conclude that BERT fine-tuning mainly changes the attention mode of the last layers and modifies the feature extraction mode of the intermediate and last layers. Moreover, we analyze the consistency of BERT fine-tuning between different <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_seed">random seeds</a> and different datasets. In summary, we provide a distinctive understanding of the learning dynamics of BERT fine-tuning, which sheds some light on improving the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fine-tuning">fine-tuning</a> results.</abstract>

      <abstract>In this paper, we propose a simple method to predict salient locations from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_(publishing)">news article text</a> using a knowledge base (KB). The proposed method uses a dictionary of locations created from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kibibyte">KB</a> to identify occurrences of locations in the text and uses the hierarchical information between entities in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kibibyte">KB</a> for assigning appropriate saliency scores to regions. It allows prediction at arbitrary region units and has only a few hyperparameters that need to be tuned. We show using manually annotated news articles that the proposed method improves the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-measure">f-measure</a> by   0.12 compared to multiple baselines.</abstract>

      <abstract>Typically, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexical_analysis">tokenization</a> is the very first step in most <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_processing">text processing</a> works. As a token serves as an atomic unit that embeds the contextual information of text, how to define a token plays a decisive role in the performance of a model. Even though Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) has been considered the de facto standard tokenization method due to its simplicity and universality, it still remains unclear whether BPE works best across all languages and tasks. In this paper, we test several tokenization strategies in order to answer our primary research question, that is, What is the best tokenization strategy for Korean NLP tasks? Experimental results demonstrate that a hybrid approach of morphological segmentation followed by BPE works best in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_language">Korean</a> to / from English machine translation and natural language understanding tasks such as KorNLI, KorSTS, NSMC, and PAWS-X. As an exception, for KorQuAD, the Korean extension of SQuAD, BPE segmentation turns out to be the most effective.

      <abstract>Named entity recognition is a critical task in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing">natural language processing field</a>. Most existing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methodology">methods</a> for this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Task_(project_management)">task</a> can only exploit <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Context_(language_use)">contextual information</a> within a sentence. However, their performance on recognizing entities in limited or ambiguous sentence-level contexts is usually unsatisfactory. Fortunately, other sentences in the same document can provide supplementary document-level contexts to help recognize these entities. In addition, words themselves contain word-level contextual information since they usually have different preferences of entity type and relative position from named entities. In this paper, we propose a unified framework to incorporate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Context_(computing)">multi-level contexts</a> for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Named-entity_recognition">named entity recognition</a>. We use TagLM as our basic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_model">model</a> to capture sentence-level contexts. To incorporate document-level contexts, we propose to capture interactions between sentences via a multi-head self attention network. To mine word-level contexts, we propose an auxiliary task to predict the type of each word to capture its type preference. We jointly train our model in entity recognition and the auxiliary classification task via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-task_learning">multi-task learning</a>. The experimental results on several <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benchmark_(computing)">benchmark datasets</a> validate the effectiveness of our <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methodology">method</a>.</abstract>

      <abstract>Commonsense explanation generation aims to empower the machine’s sense-making capability by generating plausible explanations to statements against commonsense. While this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Task_(project_management)">task</a> is easy to human, the machine still struggles to generate reasonable and informative explanations. In this work, we propose a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methodology">method</a> that first extracts the underlying concepts which are served as bridges in the reasoning chain and then integrates these <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concept">concepts</a> to generate the final explanation. To facilitate the reasoning process, we utilize external commonsense knowledge to build the connection between a statement and the bridge concepts by extracting and pruning multi-hop paths to build a subgraph. We design a bridge concept extraction model that first scores the triples, routes the paths in the subgraph, and further selects bridge concepts with weak supervision at both the triple level and the concept level. We conduct experiments on the commonsense explanation generation task and our model outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines in both automatic and human evaluation.</abstract>

      <abstract>In this paper, we aim at learning the relationships and similarities of a variety of tasks, such as humour detection, sarcasm detection, offensive content detection, motivational content detection and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentiment_analysis">sentiment analysis</a> on a somewhat complicated form of information, i.e., <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meme">memes</a>. We propose a multi-task, multi-modal deep learning framework to solve multiple tasks simultaneously. For <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_multitasking">multi-tasking</a>, we propose two attention-like mechanisms viz., Inter-task Relationship Module (iTRM) and Inter-class Relationship Module (iCRM). The main motivation of iTRM is to learn the relationship between the tasks to realize how they help each other. In contrast, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICRM">iCRM</a> develops relations between the different classes of tasks. Finally, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representation_(arts)">representations</a> from both the attentions are concatenated and shared across the five <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Task_(project_management)">tasks</a> (i.e., <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humour">humour</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarcasm">sarcasm</a>, offensive, motivational, and sentiment) for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_multitasking">multi-tasking</a>. We use the recently released dataset in the Memotion Analysis task @ SemEval 2020, which consists of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meme">memes</a> annotated for the classes as mentioned above. Empirical results on Memotion dataset show the efficacy of our proposed approach over the existing state-of-the-art systems (Baseline and SemEval 2020 winner). The evaluation also indicates that the proposed multi-task framework yields better performance over the single-task learning.</abstract>

      <abstract>We propose Implicit Quote Extractor, an end-to-end unsupervised extractive neural summarization model for conversational texts. When we reply to posts, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quotation">quotes</a> are used to highlight important part of texts. We aim to extract quoted sentences as summaries. Most replies do not explicitly include <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quotation">quotes</a>, so it is difficult to use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quotation">quotes</a> as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supervisor">supervision</a>. However, even if it is not explicitly shown, replies always refer to certain parts of texts ; we call them implicit quotes. Implicit Quote Extractor aims to extract implicit quotes as summaries. The training task of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model">model</a> is to predict whether a reply candidate is a true reply to a post. For <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction">prediction</a>, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model">model</a> has to choose a few sentences from the post. To predict accurately, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model">model</a> learns to extract sentences that replies frequently refer to. We evaluate our <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model">model</a> on two email datasets and one social media dataset, and confirm that our <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model">model</a> is useful for extractive summarization. We further discuss two topics ; one is whether quote extraction is an important factor for summarization, and the other is whether our model can capture salient sentences that conventional methods can not.</abstract>

      <abstract>In this paper, we analyse the challenges of Chinese content scoring in comparison to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language">English</a>. As a review of prior work for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_language">Chinese content scoring</a> shows a lack of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_access">open-access data</a> in the field, we present two short-answer data sets for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_language">Chinese</a>. The Chinese Educational Short Answers data set (CESA) contains 1800 student answers for five science-related questions. As a second <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_set">data set</a>, we collected ASAP-ZH with 942 answers by re-using three existing prompts from the ASAP data set. We adapt a state-of-the-art content scoring system for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_language">Chinese</a> and evaluate it in several settings on these <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_set">data sets</a>.

      <abstract>Predicting the quality of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_translation">machine translation</a> has traditionally been addressed with language-specific models, under the assumption that the quality label distribution or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_(linguistics)">linguistic features</a> exhibit traits that are not shared across languages. An obvious disadvantage of this approach is the need for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_(computing)">labelled data</a> for each given language pair. We challenge this assumption by exploring different approaches to multilingual Quality Estimation (QE), including using scores from translation models. We show that these outperform single-language models, particularly in less balanced quality label distributions and low-resource settings. In the extreme case of zero-shot QE, we show that it is possible to accurately predict <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_(business)">quality</a> for any given new language from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_model">models</a> trained on other languages. Our findings indicate that state-of-the-art neural QE models based on powerful pre-trained representations generalise well across languages, making them more applicable in real-world settings.</abstract>

      <abstract>Approaching named entities transliteration as a Neural Machine Translation (NMT) problem is common practice. While many have applied various NMT techniques to enhance machine transliteration models, few focus on the linguistic features particular to the relevant languages. In this paper, we investigate the effect of incorporating phonetic features for English-to-Chinese transliteration under the multi-task learning (MTL) settingwhere we define a phonetic auxiliary task aimed to improve the generalization performance of the main transliteration task. In addition to our system, we also release a new English-to-Chinese dataset and propose a novel evaluation metric which considers multiple possible <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transliteration">transliterations</a> given a source name. Our results show that the multi-task model achieves similar performance as the previous state of the art with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_model">model</a> of a much smaller size.</abstract>

      <abstract>Attention-based encoder-decoder models have achieved great success in neural machine translation tasks. However, the lengths of the target sequences are not explicitly predicted in these <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model">models</a>. This work proposes length prediction as an auxiliary task and set up a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subnetwork">sub-network</a> to obtain the length information from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encoder">encoder</a>. Experimental results show that the length prediction sub-network brings improvements over the strong baseline system and that the predicted length can be used as an alternative to length normalization during decoding.</abstract>

      <abstract>Transformer-based pre-trained language models (PLMs) have dramatically improved the state of the art in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing">NLP</a> across many tasks. This has led to substantial interest in analyzing the syntactic knowledge PLMs learn. Previous approaches to this question have been limited, mostly using test suites or probes. Here, we propose a novel fully unsupervised parsing approach that extracts constituency trees from PLM attention heads. We rank transformer attention heads based on their inherent properties, and create an ensemble of high-ranking heads to produce the final <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(graph_theory)">tree</a>. Our <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_(computer_programming)">method</a> is adaptable to low-resource languages, as it does not rely on development sets, which can be expensive to annotate. Our experiments show that the proposed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methodology">method</a> often outperform existing approaches if there is no development set present. Our unsupervised parser can also be used as a tool to analyze the grammars PLMs learn implicitly. For this, we use the parse trees induced by our method to train a neural PCFG and compare it to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_grammar">grammar</a> derived from a human-annotated treebank.</abstract>

      <abstract>Pairwise data automatically constructed from weakly supervised signals has been widely used for training <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning">deep learning models</a>. Pairwise datasets such as parallel texts can have uneven quality levels overall, but usually contain data subsets that are more useful as learning examples. We present two methods to refine data that are aimed to obtain that kind of subsets in a self-supervised way. Our methods are based on iteratively training dual-encoder models to compute <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Similarity_measure">similarity scores</a>. We evaluate our methods on de-noising <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_text">parallel texts</a> and training neural machine translation models. We find that : (i) The self-supervised refinement achieves most machine translation gains in the first iteration, but following iterations further improve its intrinsic evaluation. (ii) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_translation">Machine translations</a> can improve the de-noising performance when combined with selection steps. (iii) Our <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_(computer_programming)">methods</a> are able to reach the performance of a supervised method. Being entirely self-supervised, our <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_(computer_programming)">methods</a> are well-suited to handle pairwise data without the need of prior knowledge or human annotations.</abstract>

This survey presents an overview of the current state of Explainable AI (XAI), considered within the domain of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing">Natural Language Processing (NLP)</a>. We discuss the main categorization of explanations, as well as the various ways explanations can be arrived at and visualized. We detail the operations and explainability techniques currently available for generating explanations for NLP model predictions, to serve as a resource for model developers in the community. Finally, we point out the current gaps and encourage directions for future work in this important research area.</abstract>

      <abstract>Fine-tuning (FT) pre-trained sentence embedding models on small datasets has been shown to have limitations. In this paper we show that concatenating the embeddings from the pre-trained model with those from a simple sentence embedding model trained only on the target data, can improve over the performance of FT for few-sample tasks. To this end, a linear classifier is trained on the combined embeddings, either by freezing the embedding model weights or training the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_classification">classifier</a> and embedding models end-to-end. We perform evaluation on seven small datasets from NLP tasks and show that our approach with end-to-end training outperforms FT with negligible <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overhead_(computing)">computational overhead</a>. Further, we also show that sophisticated combination techniques like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concatenation">CCA</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concatenation">KCCA</a> do not work as well in practice as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concatenation">concatenation</a>.

First, we construct and release a new dense video captioning dataset, Video Timeline Tags (ViTT), featuring a variety of instructional videos together with time-stamped annotations. Second, we explore several multimodal sequence-to-sequence pretraining strategies that leverage large unsupervised datasets of videos and caption-like texts.

      <abstract>Point-of-Interest (POI) oriented question answering (QA) aims to return a list of POIs given a question issued by a user. Recent advances in intelligent virtual assistants have opened the possibility of engaging the client software more actively in the provision of location-based services, thereby showing great promise for automatic POI retrieval. Some existing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_assurance">QA methods</a> can be adopted on this task such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_assurance">QA similarity calculation</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_parsing">semantic parsing</a> using pre-defined rules. The returned results, however, are subject to inherent limitations due to the lack of the ability for handling some important POI related information, including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tag_(metadata)">tags</a>, location entities, and proximity-related terms (e.g. nearby, close). In this paper, we present a novel deep learning framework integrated with joint inference to capture both tag semantic and geographic correlation between question and POIs. One characteristic of our model is to propose a special cross attention question embedding neural network structure to obtain question-to-POI and POI-to-question information. Besides, we utilize a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skewness">skewed distribution</a> to simulate the spatial relationship between questions and POIs. By measuring the results offered by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model">model</a> against existing methods, we demonstrate its robustness and practicability, and supplement our conclusions with empirical evidence.</abstract>

      <abstract>Automatically generating stories is a challenging problem that requires producing causally related and logical sequences of events about a topic. Previous approaches in this domain have focused largely on one-shot generation, where a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_model">language model</a> outputs a complete story based on limited initial input from a user. Here, we instead focus on the task of interactive story generation, where the user provides the model mid-level sentence abstractions in the form of cue phrases during the generation process. This provides an interface for human users to guide the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storytelling">story generation</a>. We present two content-inducing approaches to effectively incorporate this additional information. Experimental results from both automatic and human evaluations show that these <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methodology">methods</a> produce more topically coherent and personalized stories compared to baseline methods.</abstract>

      <abstract>Sports game summarization focuses on generating news articles from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_commentator">live commentaries</a>. Unlike traditional summarization tasks, the source documents and the target summaries for sports game summarization tasks are written in quite different writing styles. In addition, live commentaries usually contain many <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Named_entity">named entities</a>, which makes summarizing sports games precisely very challenging. To deeply study this task, we present SportsSum, a Chinese sports game summarization dataset which contains 5,428 soccer games of live commentaries and the corresponding <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_(publishing)">news articles</a>. Additionally, we propose a two-step summarization model consisting of a selector and a rewriter for SportsSum. To evaluate the correctness of generated sports summaries, we design two novel score metrics : name matching score and event matching score. Experimental results show that our <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model">model</a> performs better than other summarization baselines on ROUGE scores as well as the two designed scores.</abstract>

      <abstract>Large-scale natural language inference (NLI) datasets such as SNLI or MNLI have been created by asking crowdworkers to read a premise and write three new hypotheses, one for each possible semantic relationships (entailment, contradiction, and neutral). While this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication_protocol">protocol</a> has been used to create useful benchmark data, it remains unclear whether the writing-based annotation protocol is optimal for any purpose, since it has not been evaluated directly. Furthermore, there is ample evidence that crowdworker writing can introduce artifacts in the data. We investigate two alternative <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication_protocol">protocols</a> which automatically create candidate (premise, hypothesis) pairs for annotators to label. Using these protocols and a writing-based baseline, we collect several new English NLI datasets of over 3k examples each, each using a fixed amount of annotator time, but a varying number of examples to fit that time budget. Our experiments on NLI and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_learning">transfer learning</a> show negative results : None of the alternative protocols outperforms the baseline in evaluations of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalization">generalization</a> within NLI or on transfer to outside target tasks. We conclude that crowdworker writing still the best known option for entailment data, highlighting the need for further data collection work to focus on improving writing-based annotation processes.</abstract>

      <abstract>Providing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instant_messaging">instant response</a> for product-related questions in E-commerce question answering platforms can greatly improve users’ online shopping experience. However, existing product question answering (PQA) methods only consider a single information source such as user reviews and/or require large amounts of labeled data. In this paper, we propose a novel framework to tackle the PQA task via exploiting heterogeneous information including natural language text and attribute-value pairs from two information sources of the concerned product, namely product details and user reviews. A heterogeneous information encoding component is then designed for obtaining unified representations of information with different formats. The sources of the candidate snippets are also incorporated when measuring the question-snippet relevance. Moreover, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_framework">framework</a> is trained with a specifically designed weak supervision paradigm making use of available answers in the training phase. Experiments on a real-world dataset show that our proposed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_framework">framework</a> achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art models.</abstract>

      <abstract>Most previous work on knowledge graph completion conducted single-view prediction or calculation for candidate triple evaluation, based only on the content information of the candidate triples. This paper describes a novel multi-view classification model for knowledge graph completion, where multiple classification views are performed based on both content and context information for candidate triple evaluation. Each classification view evaluates the validity of a candidate triple from a specific viewpoint, based on the content information inside the candidate triple and the context information nearby the triple. These classification views are implemented by a unified neural network and the classification predictions are weightedly integrated to obtain the final evaluation. Experiments show that, the multi-view model brings very significant improvements over previous methods, and achieves the new state-of-the-art on two representative datasets. We believe that, the flexibility and the scalability of the multi-view classification model facilitates the introduction of additional information and resources for better performance.</abstract>

      <abstract>Within the prosperity of Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs), the education applications that automatically provide extracurricular knowledge for MOOC users become rising research topics. However, MOOC courses’ diversity and rapid updates make it more challenging to find suitable new knowledge for students. In this paper, we present ExpanRL, an end-to-end hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) model for concept expansion in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massive_open_online_course">MOOCs</a>. Employing a two-level HRL mechanism of seed selection and concept expansion, ExpanRL is more feasible to adjust the expansion strategy to find new concepts based on the students’ feedback on expansion results. Our experiments on nine novel datasets from real MOOCs show that ExpanRL achieves significant improvements over existing methods and maintain competitive performance under different settings.</abstract>

      <abstract>Explainable recommendation is a good way to improve user satisfaction. However, explainable recommendation in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialogue">dialogue</a> is challenging since it has to handle <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language">natural language</a> as both input and output. To tackle the challenge, this paper proposes a novel and practical task to explain evidences in recommending hotels given vague requests expressed freely in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language">natural language</a>. We decompose the process into two subtasks on hotel reviews : Evidence Identification and Evidence Explanation. The former predicts whether or not a sentence contains evidence that expresses why a given request is satisfied. The latter generates a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentence_(law)">recommendation sentence</a> given a request and an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentence_(law)">evidence sentence</a>. In order to address these subtasks, we build an Evidence-based Explanation dataset, which is the largest <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_set">dataset</a> for explaining evidences in recommending hotels for vague requests. The experimental results demonstrate that the BERT model can find evidence sentences with respect to various vague requests and that the LSTM-based model can generate recommendation sentences.</abstract>

      <abstract>In this paper, we propose an effective deep learning framework for multilingual and code- mixed visual question answering. The pro- posed model is capable of predicting answers from the questions in Hindi, English or Code- mixed (Hinglish : Hindi-English) languages. The majority of the existing techniques on Vi- sual Question Answering (VQA) focus on En- glish questions only. However, many applica- tions such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging">medical imaging</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourism">tourism</a>, visual assistants require a multilinguality-enabled module for their widespread usages. As there is no available dataset in English-Hindi VQA, we firstly create Hindi and Code-mixed VQA datasets by exploiting the linguistic properties of these languages. We propose a robust tech- nique capable of handling the multilingual and code-mixed question to provide the answer against the visual information (image). To better encode the multilingual and code-mixed questions, we introduce a hierarchy of shared layers. We control the behaviour of these shared layers by an attention-based soft layer sharing mechanism, which learns how shared layers are applied in different ways for the dif- ferent languages of the question. Further, our model uses bi-linear attention with a residual connection to fuse the language and image fea- tures. We perform extensive evaluation and ablation studies for English, Hindi and Code- mixed VQA. The evaluation shows that the proposed multilingual model achieves state-of- the-art performance in all these settings.</abstract>

      <abstract>Stance classification can be a powerful tool for understanding whether and which users believe in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rumor">online rumours</a>. The task aims to automatically predict the stance of replies towards a given <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rumor">rumour</a>, namely support, deny, question, or comment. Numerous methods have been proposed and their performance compared in the RumourEval shared tasks in 2017 and 2019. Results demonstrated that this is a challenging problem since naturally occurring rumour stance data is highly imbalanced. This paper specifically questions the evaluation metrics used in these shared <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Task_(project_management)">tasks</a>. We re-evaluate the systems submitted to the two RumourEval tasks and show that the two widely adopted metrics   <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision">accuracy</a> and macro-F1   are not robust for the four-class imbalanced task of rumour stance classification, as they wrongly favour systems with highly skewed accuracy towards the majority class. To overcome this problem, we propose new evaluation metrics for rumour stance detection. These are not only robust to imbalanced data but also score higher systems that are capable of recognising the two most informative minority classes (support and deny).</abstract>

      <abstract>Obtaining social media demographic information using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning">machine learning</a> is important for efficient computational social science research. Automatic age classification has been accomplished with relative success and allows for the study of youth populations, but student classificationdetermining which users are currently attending an academic institutionhas not been thoroughly studied. Previous work (He et al., 2016) proposes a model which utilizes 3 tweet-content features to classify users as students or non-students. This <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model">model</a> achieves an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision">accuracy</a> of 84 %, but is restrictive and time intensive because it requires accessing and processing many user tweets. In this study, we propose <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_classification">classification models</a> which use 7 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_(machine_learning)">numerical features</a> and 10 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_(machine_learning)">text-based features</a> drawn from simple profile information. These profile-based features allow for faster, more accessible data collection and enable the classification of users without needing access to their tweets. Compared to previous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model">models</a>, our <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model">models</a> identify students with greater <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision">accuracy</a> ; our best model obtains an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision">accuracy</a> of 88.1 % and an F1 score of.704. This improved student identification tool has the potential to facilitate research on topics ranging from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_network">professional networking</a> to the impact of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education">education</a> on Twitter behaviors.</abstract>

      <abstract>WikiSQL and Spider, the large-scale cross-domain text-to-SQL datasets, have attracted much attention from the research community. The leaderboards of WikiSQL and Spider show that many researchers propose their models trying to solve the text-to-SQL problem. This paper first divides the top <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model">models</a> in these two leaderboards into two paradigms. We then present details not mentioned in their original paper by evaluating the key components, including schema linking, pretrained word embeddings, and reasoning assistance modules. Based on the analysis of these models, we want to promote understanding of the text-to-SQL field and find out some interesting future works, for example, it is worth studying the text-to-SQL problem in an environment where it is more challenging to build schema linking and also worth studying combing the advantage of each model toward text-to-SQL.</abstract>

      <abstract>Computational approaches to noun ellipsis resolution has been sparse, with only a naive rule-based approach that uses syntactic feature constraints for marking noun ellipsis licensors and selecting their antecedents. In this paper, we further the ellipsis research by exploring several statistical and neural models for both the subtasks involved in the ellipsis resolution process and addressing the representation and contribution of manual features proposed in previous research. Using the best performing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_model">models</a>, we build an end-to-end supervised Machine Learning (ML) framework for this task that improves the existing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-number">F1 score</a> by 16.55 % for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detection">detection</a> and 14.97 % for the resolution subtask. Our experiments demonstrate robust scores through pretrained BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) embeddings for word representation, and more so the importance of manual features once again highlighting the syntactic and semantic characteristics of the ellipsis phenomenon. For the classification decision, we notice that a simple Multilayar Perceptron (MLP) works well for the detection of ellipsis ; however, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) are a better choice for the much harder resolution step.</abstract>

      <abstract>Several recent state-of-the-art transfer learning methods model classification tasks as text generation, where labels are represented as strings for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_model">model</a> to generate. We investigate the effect that the choice of strings used to represent labels has on how effectively the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model">model</a> learns the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Task_(project_management)">task</a>. For four standard text classification tasks, we design a diverse set of possible <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_(computer_science)">string representations</a> for labels, ranging from canonical label definitions to random strings. We experiment with T5 on these tasks, varying the label representations as well as the amount of training data. We find that, in the low data setting, label representation impacts task performance on some tasks, with task-related labels being most effective, but fails to have an impact on others. In the full data setting, our results are largely negative : Different label representations do not affect overall task performance.</abstract>

Even though the source codes of many neural network models are publicly available, there is still a large gap from open-sourced models to solving real-world problems in enterprises. Therefore, to fill this gap, we introduce AutoNLU, an on-demand cloud-based system with an easy-to-use interface that covers all common use-cases and steps in developing an NLU model. AutoNLU has supported many product teams within Adobe with different use-cases and datasets, quickly delivering them working models. To demonstrate the effectiveness of AutoNLU, we present two case studies. i) We build a practical NLU model for handling various image-editing requests in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Photoshop">Photoshop</a>. ii) We build powerful keyphrase extraction models that achieve state-of-the-art results on two public benchmarks. In both cases, end users only need to write a small amount of code to convert their datasets into a common format used by AutoNLU.</abstract>
