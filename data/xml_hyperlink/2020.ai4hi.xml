      <abstract>The aim of this position paper is to establish an initial approach to the automatic classification of digital images about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outsider_art">Outsider Art style of painting</a>. Specifically, we explore whether is it possible to classify non-traditional artistic styles by using the same features that are used for classifying traditional styles? Our research question is motivated by two facts. First, art historians state that non-traditional styles are influenced by factors outside of the world of art. Second, some studies have shown that several <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Style_(visual_arts)">artistic styles</a> confound certain classification techniques. Following current approaches to style prediction, this paper utilises Deep Learning methods to encode <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_(computer_vision)">image features</a>. Our preliminary experiments have provided motivation to think that, as is the case with traditional styles, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outsider_art">Outsider Art</a> can be computationally modelled with objective means by using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training,_validation,_and_test_sets">training datasets</a> and CNN models. Nevertheless, our results are not conclusive due to the lack of a large available dataset on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outsider_art">Outsider Art</a>. Therefore, at the end of the paper, we have mapped future lines of action, which include the compilation of a large dataset of Outsider Art images and the creation of an ontology of Outsider Art.</abstract>

      <abstract>Semantic enrichment of historical images to build interactive AI systems for the Digital Humanities domain has recently gained significant attention. However, before implementing any semantic enrichment tool for building <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence">AI systems</a>, it is also crucial to analyse the quality and richness of the existing datasets and understand the areas where semantic enrichment is most required. Here, we propose an approach to conducting a preliminary analysis of selected historical images from the Europeana platform using existing linked data quality assessment tools. The analysis targets food images by collecting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metadata">metadata</a> provided from curators such as Galleries, Libraries, Archives and Museums (GLAMs) and cultural aggregators such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europeana">Europeana</a>. We identified <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_(mathematics)">metrics</a> to evaluate the quality of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metadata">metadata</a> associated with food-related images which are harvested from the Europeana platform. In this paper, we present the food-image dataset, the associated <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metadata">metadata</a> and our proposed method for the assessment. The results of our assessment will be used to guide the current effort to semantically enrich the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_image">images</a> and build high-quality metadata using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_vision">Computer Vision</a>.</abstract>
