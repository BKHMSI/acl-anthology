      <abstract>Word embeddings such as Word2Vec not only uniquely identify words but also encode important semantic information about them. However, as single entities they are difficult to interpret and their individual dimensions do not have obvious meanings. A more intuitive and interpretable <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_space">feature space</a> based on neural representations of words was presented by Binder and colleagues (2016) but is only available for a very limited vocabulary. Previous research (Utsumi, 2018) indicates that Binder features can be predicted for words from their embedding vectors (such as Word2Vec), but only looked at the original Binder vocabulary. This paper aimed to demonstrate that Binder features can effectively be predicted for a large number of new words and that the predicted values are sensible. The results supported this, showing that correlations between predicted feature values were consistent with those in the original Binder dataset. Additionally, vectors of predicted values performed comparatively to established embedding models in tests of word-pair semantic similarity. Being able to predict Binder feature space vectors for any number of new words opens up many uses not possible with the original vocabulary size.</abstract>

      <abstract>Texts comprise a large part of visual information that we process every day, so one of the tasks of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_science">language science</a> is to make them more accessible. However, often the text design process is focused on the font size, but not on its type ; which might be crucial especially for the people with reading disabilities. The current paper represents a study on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accessibility">text accessibility</a> and the first attempt to create a research-based accessible font for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyrillic_script">Cyrillic letters</a>. This resulted in the dyslexic-specific font, LexiaD. Its design rests on the reduction of inter-letter similarity of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_alphabet">Russian alphabet</a>. In evaluation stage, dyslexic and non-dyslexic children were asked to read sentences from the Children version of the Russian Sentence Corpus. We tested the readability of LexiaD compared to PT Sans and PT Serif fonts. The results showed that all children had some advantage in letter feature extraction and information integration while reading in LexiaD, but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexical_access">lexical access</a> was improved when sentences were rendered in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PT_Sans">PT Sans</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PT_Serif">PT Serif</a>. Therefore, in several aspects, LexiaD proved to be faster to read and could be recommended to use by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyslexia">dyslexics</a> who have visual deficiency or those who struggle with text understanding resulting in re-reading.</abstract>

      <abstract>We present the Le Petit Prince Corpus (LPPC), a multi-lingual resource for research in (computational) psycho- and neurolinguistics. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_corpus">corpus</a> consists of the children’s story The Little Prince in 26 languages. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_set">dataset</a> is in the process of being built using state-of-the-art methods for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_processing">speech and language processing</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroencephalography">electroencephalography (EEG)</a>. The planned release of LPPC dataset will include raw text annotated with dependency graphs in the Universal Dependencies standard, a near-natural-sounding synthetic spoken subset as well as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroencephalography">EEG recordings</a>. We will use this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_corpus">corpus</a> for conducting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurolinguistics">neurolinguistic studies</a> that generalize across a wide range of languages, overcoming <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_typology">typological constraints</a> to traditional approaches. The planned release of the LPPC combines linguistic and EEG data for many languages using fully automatic methods, and thus constitutes a readily extendable resource that supports cross-linguistic and cross-disciplinary research.</abstract>

      <title>Sensorimotor Norms for 506 Russian Nouns<fixed-case>R</fixed-case>ussian Nouns</title>

      <abstract>Embodied cognitive science suggested a number of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(mathematics)">variables</a> describing our sensorimotor experience associated with different concepts : modality experience rating (i.e., relationship between words and images of a particular perceptive modalityvisual, auditory, haptic etc.), manipulability (the necessity for an object to interact with human hands in order to perform its function), vertical spatial localization. According to the embodied cognition theory, these semantic variables capture our <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_representation">mental representations</a> and thus should influence <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_formation">word learning</a>, processing and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_formation">production</a>. However, it is not clear how these new <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_and_attribute_(research)">variables</a> are related to such traditional <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_and_attribute_(research)">variables</a> as imageability, age of acquisition (AoA) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_frequency">word frequency</a>. In the presented database, normative data on the modality (visual, auditory, haptic, olfactory, and gustatory) ratings, vertical spatial localization of the object, manipulability, imageability, age of acquisition, and subjective frequency for 506 Russian nouns are collected. Factor analysis revealed four factors : (1) visual and haptic modality ratings were combined with imageability, manipulability and AoA ; (2) word length, frequency and AoA ; (3) olfactory modality was united with gustatory ; (4) spatial localization only was included in the fourth factor. The database is available online together with a publication describing the method of data collection and data parameters (Miklashevsky, 2018).</abstract>
