      <abstract>This paper proposes a semantics ABS for the model-theoretic interpretation of annotation structures. It provides a language ABSr, that represents semantic forms in a (possibly -free) type-theoretic first-order logic. For semantic compositionality, the representation language introduces two operators   and   with subtypes for the conjunctive or distributive composition of semantic forms. ABS also introduces a small set of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predicate_(mathematical_logic)">logical predicates</a> to represent semantic forms in a simplified format. The use of ABSr is illustrated with some annotation structures that conform to ISO 24617 standards on semantic annotation such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO-TimeML">ISO-TimeML</a> and ISO-Space.<i>semantic forms</i> in a (possibly <tex-math>\lambda</tex-math>-free) type-theoretic first-order logic. For semantic compositionality, the representation language introduces two operators <tex-math>\oplus</tex-math> and <tex-math>\oslash</tex-math> with subtypes for the conjunctive or distributive composition of semantic forms. ABS also introduces a small set of logical predicates to represent semantic forms in a simplified format. The use of ABSr is illustrated with some annotation structures that conform to ISO 24617 standards on semantic annotation such as ISO-TimeML and ISO-Space.</abstract>
