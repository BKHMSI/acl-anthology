      <abstract>Social media have become a valuable source of information. However, its power to shape public opinion can be dangerous, especially in the case of misinformation. The existing studies on misinformation detection hypothesise that the initial message is fake. In contrast, we focus on information distortion occurring in cascades as the initial message is quoted or receives a reply. We show a significant topic shift in information cascades on Twitter during the Covid-19 pandemic providing valuable insights for the automatic analysis of information distortion.</abstract>

      <abstract>Online news do not always come from reliable sources and they are not always even realistic. The constantly growing number of online textual data has raised the need for detecting deception and bias in texts from different domains recently. In this paper, we identify different types of unrealistic news (clickbait and fake news written for entertainment purposes) written in Hungarian on the basis of a rich feature set and with the help of machine learning methods. Our tool achieves competitive scores: it is able to classify clickbait, fake news written for entertainment purposes and real news with an accuracy of over 80%. It is also highlighted that morphological features perform the best in this classification task.</abstract>

      <abstract>One very common type of fake news is satire which comes in a form of a news website or an online platform that parodies reputable real news agencies to create a sarcastic version of reality. This type of fake news is often disseminated by individuals on their online platforms as it has a much stronger effect in delivering criticism than through a straightforward message. However, when the satirical text is disseminated via social media without mention of its source, it can be mistaken for real news. This study conducts several exploratory analyses to identify the linguistic properties of Arabic fake news with satirical content. It shows that although it parodies real news, Arabic satirical news has distinguishing features on the lexico-grammatical level. We exploit these features to build a number of machine learning models capable of identifying satirical fake news with an accuracy of up to 98.6%. The study introduces a new dataset (3185 articles) scraped from two Arabic satirical news websites (&#8216;Al-Hudood&#8217; and &#8216;Al-Ahram Al-Mexici&#8217;) which consists of fake news. The real news dataset consists of 3710 articles collected from three official news sites: the &#8216;BBC-Arabic&#8217;, the &#8216;CNN-Arabic&#8217; and &#8216;Al-Jazeera news&#8217;. Both datasets are concerned with political issues related to the Middle East.</abstract>
